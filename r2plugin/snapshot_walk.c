/* Serializes an owned radare2 function snapshot into the flat wire format.
 *
 * radare2 used to publish the snapshot as an opaque handle behind an accessor
 * per field, and this file called them. It now publishes the struct itself, so
 * the reads below are field reads. Nothing about the wire format changed: the
 * same values are written in the same order, including where the old accessors
 * had a contract worth preserving rather than tidying.
 *
 * The one such contract is string absence. Every accessor copied through
 * r_str_get, so a NULL string arrived as an empty one and returned success;
 * only a string too long for the caller's buffer was a refusal. walk_bounded
 * keeps exactly that distinction, because the reader asserts this format byte
 * for byte and would notice an absent string that used to be an empty one.
 *
 * Field order must match r2source::snapshot_wire::encode_snapshot exactly. That
 * order is asserted by decoding what this writes, so a mismatch fails a test
 * rather than producing a buffer the parser silently misreads. */
