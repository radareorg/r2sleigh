/* Flat snapshot wire writer.
 *
 * Producer side of the transport that replaces the accessor table. radare2
 * serializes one function snapshot into a single self-describing buffer instead
 * of implementing a callback per field, so the C boundary carries one buffer
 * rather than 67 entry points and 31 struct sizes kept in lockstep.
 *
 * The encoding is owned by r2source::snapshot_wire. ABI spelling is classified
 * exactly once by r2source while decoding rather than duplicated in C. */
