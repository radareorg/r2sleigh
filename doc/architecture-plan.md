# Architecture plan: dispositions, bindings, and projections

Execution status as of 2026-08-31 on `codex/binding-spine-rewrite`. All four
properties of section 1 now have a passing proof gate: `placement_audit` 54/54
with the structured-region artifact retained and sealed, the strict-dialect raw
compile 54/54, `shuffled_block_schedule_keeps_spans_bindings_placement_and_bytes_identical`
passing for determinism, and `effect_obligations` and `render_refusal` 54/54 for
the ledger. The corpus is at parity: generation, raw, diagnostic and differential
all 54 of 54.

The section 3 defect is removed. `UseInfo` is five fields rather than
thirty-one; `carrier_alias`, `var_alias`, `value_ids_by_name`, `unkeyed_writes`
and `formatted_defs` no longer exist, which is A1, A2 and A4. A3 closed last:
`value_ids_by_var`, `vars_by_value_id`, `ambiguous_value_vars` and
`ambiguous_value_ids` were four `pub(crate)` fields holding one relation, each
independently writable, so a caller could read one direction and be
contradicted by the other. They are now a single private `ExactValueIdentities`
whose only mutator is `bind`, reached only through `UseInfo::bind_value_id`.
Both directions and the poison sets are still stored, because the accessors are
asked questions both ways and the asymptotics rule in section 9 says a lookup is
not a scan -- but they can no longer be written apart, and a test asserts the
directions agree. No field of `UseInfo` is now written by more than one pass,
which is A3's gate.

The measurements in the table below are from `ed7dfdc` and are stale. Current
figures: 0 clippy diagnostics (was 184), 0 build warnings (was 57), 26
`allow(dead_code)` (was 46), 203 `display_name()` call sites (was 684). The
fourteen TODO/FIXME/HACK hits are mostly not debt -- eleven are radare2's own
ESIL `TODO` keyword, which halts its evaluator; only three are real, all in
`r2dec/src/structure.rs`.

Stage commits:

- stage 0, the honest 54-cell harness, is committed at `e787934`;
- stage 1, the non-consuming binding-plan contract, is committed at `5078419`;
- stage 2, canonical spans and sealed register/use/write projections, is
  committed at `8c56573`, `697cc9a`, `00eccbb`, and `d7b378d`;
- stage 3, the topology-only lowering split, is committed at `32f7adc`;
- the exact loop-edge `UseSite` prerequisite for stage 5 is committed at
  `ce53a33`;
- the source-coherence fix that retains outputless literal leaves is committed
  at `798a742`;
- stage 4, the independent non-consuming binding audit, is committed at
  `6f6cc33`.

Every completed stage preserved all 54 raw-output snapshots byte-for-byte. The
strict raw baseline reports 0 passing, 26 compile failures, 27 signature
mismatches, and 1 blocked renderer error. The old “38 of 54” number was produced
only after the harness erased declared types and is not a quality measurement.

Revision 2. Revision 1 proposed one `Binding` per `ValueId`. That model was
wrong at the cardinality, rebuilt an upstream fact downstream, and was gated on
measurements the harness cannot make. This revision replaces it.

## 1. The end goal

The decompiler should produce, for any function it accepts, a single C rendering
whose correctness is *structural* rather than observed. "Done" is four
properties, each with a stated way of being proved — and none of them is proved
by a corpus pass count.

1. **Every emitted identifier is declared once, in a scope that dominates every
   surviving read, and is assigned before that read on every path.** Proved by
   construction: the phase that decides a value is named is the phase that emits
   its declaration, and placement is derived from a sealed structured-region
   artifact rather than stored. The current structurer consumes and discards
   `Region`, so stage 7 must first retain that artifact.
2. **Every use renders the exact slice it consumes.** Proved by an internal
   invariant — every `UseSite` carries a projection backed by an upstream
   canonical fact — and tripwired externally by compiling the untouched emitted
   declarations under a strict dialect with warnings as errors.
3. **The rendering is deterministic.** Proved by a property test that shuffles
   input orderings and requires the same partition, the same bindings, and
   byte-identical output.
4. **Every obligation is accounted for.** `rendered + justified_elision +
   refused = total obligations`, and `unaccounted = 0`. Separately, `refused` is
   an explicit failure and `defects = 0` for output the decompiler accepts.

The corpus is a canary against regression. It is not the specification, and no
gate below is satisfied by passing it. Section 6 says why.

## 3. The one defect

> **A value has many tables that can answer for it, and they are allowed to
> disagree.**

The exhibit is `UseInfo` in `crates/r2dec/src/analysis/mod.rs`, at **36 fields**.
Several are one fact keyed differently: `value_ids_by_var`, `value_ids_by_name`
and `vars_by_value_id` are one relation in three directions, each writable
independently; `ambiguous_value_vars` / `ambiguous_value_ids` /
`ambiguous_value_names` are one set under three key types; `definitions_by_value`
is value-keyed where `formatted_defs` is string-keyed.

The tree already admits it. The struct's last field is a shipped counter of the
drift, whose comment says the drift is structural rather than a discipline
failure at the call sites:

```rust
/// Writes that reached the string-keyed half and not the value-keyed one.
/// ...
/// Those entries are exactly what the location model has to account for
/// before the string-keyed half can be derived rather than stored ...
pub(crate) unkeyed_writes: BTreeMap<&'static str, usize>,
```

### What the shape cost, observed

- **Six inert fixes in a row.** Each edited a rule governing the *name* when the
  rule on the path governed the *value*, or the reverse. Located only by planting
  `CExpr::External { name: "ZZMARKERZZ" }` and grepping `pd:s`.
- **Three measured regressions from single-table edits.** Span-gate widening
  37 → 19; a guard on the `Block` arm of `structure_region` 37 → 17; excluding
  self-zeroing writes in parameter recovery 37 → 36. Each was correct alone;
  another table still answered, and the answers differed.
- **A rendering non-determinism** from `close_carrier_aliases_over_edge_copies`
  making one unordered, non-fixpoint pass over edges.
- **A naming ladder** — `carrier_alias` → `var_alias` → `param_alias` → base —
  over 225 sites, where which rung answers depends on insertion order in tables
  written by different passes.

The project's standing rule — trace a defect to its source, fix it there, never
at the symptom site — is *unimplementable* under this shape, because "the source"
is not a place. That is the thing to fix.

---

## 4. The model

Five identities. **Four already exist in the tree.** Only `BindingId` is new.

```
CanonicalLocation   the machine place       r2source/src/contracts.rs:30
SpanId              one uninterrupted run   r2ssa/src/span.rs:24
ValueId             one SSA version         r2ssa/src/graph.rs:17
UseSite             one consumption         r2ssa/src/graph.rs:20
BindingId           one rendered C object   (new)
```

### This is not a hierarchy

Revision 1 arranged these as a strict containment chain with
`Binding -> Option<CanonicalLocation>`. That is wrong, and the tree says why in
two places. `r2ssa/src/span.rs` opens:

> A register is not a variable. A compiler will keep an accumulator in `RAX` for
> one loop and an index in it for the next, and every layer that reasons about
> "the value in `RAX`" then has to decide which of those it means.

and `normalize.rs:1057`:

> an entry value, a phi, a latch update and a post-loop merge are four SSA values
> and one C local.

So the relation runs both ways. One `CanonicalLocation` holds several unrelated
program variables over time; one recovered variable moves register → stack →
register. `Binding -> Option<CanonicalLocation>` is only valid in the restricted
single-location case, which is not the general one.

The correct shape:

```
CanonicalLocation ──has temporal contents──▶ SpanId
SpanId              ──contains──────────────▶ ValueId
ValueId              ──is consumed at────────▶ UseSite

BindingId ──coalesces a certified set of──▶ ValueId / SpanId
```

`BindingId` is a **renderer projection across the SSA graph**, not a child of a
machine location. It references an upstream coalescing or carrier certificate; it
never stores a second origin claim of its own. That distinction is the whole
correction: revision 1's `Origin { Carrier { id, width }, StackSlot(off), ... }`
rebuilt `CanonicalLocation` inside the renderer, which is the same defect this
plan exists to remove, committed by the plan itself.

The certificate inside a sealed `Binding` is opaque outside the binding-plan
module. A `SpanId` or `SemanticId` is only the identity of a candidate upstream
fact, not proof by itself. Sealing must resolve that identity against the exact
`SourceOwnedFunctionFacts` authority and prove that the values whose dispositions
name the binding are exactly the certified member set. `Singleton` likewise means
exactly one bound value after that check; it is not a freely constructible claim.

### Disposition, not a nullable name

Revision 1 held `name: Option<SymbolId>` beside an independent `Site`, which
permits invalid combinations and detects them with a debug assertion. Encode the
legal states instead, so the invalid ones cannot be written:

```rust
enum ValueDisposition {
    Bound   { binding: BindingId },
    Inline  { expr: MachineExprId, proof: InlineProof },
    Elided  { reason: ElisionReason, proof: DeadValueProof },
    Refused { reason: RefusalReason },
}
```

Validation returns a typed refusal in release builds. A malformed artifact must
not silently render, and must not panic during `pd:s`.

### Width belongs to the use

One value is read at several widths. A single declaration type cannot describe
that, and cannot express `AH`, SIMD lanes, extraction offsets, partial writes, or
target-specific zero-extension. `CanonicalLocation` exists precisely because
`CanonicalStorageId` conflates the place with the slice:

> A `CanonicalStorageId` records a slice: `EAX` and `RAX` differ in it because
> they differ in size, which makes two writes to one register look like writes to
> two places. A location is the register, and the slice is what a particular
> access took of it.

So the canonical upstream contract is:

```rust
struct Binding { declaration_type: CType, /* ... */ }

/// What one reader takes of the binding. Keyed by `UseSite`.
enum MachineUseDisposition {
    Exact(MachineUseSlice),
    Refused(MachineUseRefusal),
}

/// What one definition puts back. Keyed by definition site.
enum MachineWriteDisposition {
    Exact(MachineWriteProjection),
    Refused(MachineWriteRefusal),
}
```

`ZeroExtend` is where `narrow_write_clears_register` moves: it stops being a
predicate consulted at render time and becomes a fact recorded at the definition.
`BindingPlan` owns one validated `MachineProjection` and delegates both lookups
to it. Copying slice or write geometry into renderer-owned tables, even with an
opaque proof beside each copy, would create the second answerer this rewrite is
removing.

### Placement is derived, never stored

Declaration placement is a pure lowering phase immediately before AST emission:

```
sealed structured-region artifact
  + binding definitions
  + surviving planned uses
  → declaration location | PlacementRefusal
```

No parallel authoritative placement table. The emitted AST contains the resulting
declaration, and that is the only record. Storing a placement plus a proof of the
placement would recreate exactly the two-answerers defect: the stored placement
and the region tree it came from can drift.

Three things the calculation must keep separate:

1. **Declaration scope** — where the C object is introduced.
2. **Initialization and assignment sites** — where values are written into it.
3. **Reaching-definition validity** — whether every surviving read is preceded by
   an assignment on every path.

These are not the same question, and conflating them is a way to be wrong
quietly: **hoisting a declaration can make C compile without fixing a read that is
semantically uninitialized.** A value assigned in both arms of an `if` and read
after the merge needs one declaration before the `if`, an assignment in each arm,
and the read after — hoisting alone produces the same text whether or not the
second arm actually assigns. Reaching-definition validity is what separates them,
and a failure of it is a `PlacementRefusal`, not a hoist.

The calculation uses **surviving planned uses**, not every original SSA use.
Inlined, elided and refused values have no uses to dominate.

### The obligation ledger

Value disposition and effect disposition are separate ledgers. "Zero readers"
justifies removing a *pure* computation only; a call, a store, a volatile load or
a `callother` must survive with no readers at all. This is not a refinement — it
is on the critical path, because `callother` is one of the open corpus failures.

Accounting is two equations, kept apart from quality:

```
rendered + justified_elision + refused = total obligations
unaccounted = 0
```

and then, separately:

```
refused  = explicit failure, never success
defects  = 0 for output the decompiler accepts as native
```

The split is what stops both games. "Declare everything" cannot satisfy the first
equation without also raising `defects`. "Refuse everything" satisfies the first
equation and fails outright on the second. The tree already prints this shape:
`632 rendered, 38 elided, 0 refused, 11 unaccounted, 96 defects`.

### Determinism

The rule is not a container choice:

> Every closure computes a unique least fixpoint using a monotone transfer over a
> stable domain; scheduling uses a sorted worklist.

`ValueId` allocation is already dense and stable for one exact prepared
artifact: `graph.rs` interns `ValueId(values.len())` while walking canonical
reverse-postorder blocks, then phi and op operands in their stored order. The
`BTreeMap` is only the reverse interning index; it does not choose allocation
order. Indexed vectors therefore give deterministic O(1) lookup and iteration
without claiming that IDs survive a changed traversal.
But the actual determinism bug on this branch was not map order; it was a single
non-fixpoint pass. Dense storage does not address that class.

Where the relation is genuinely an equivalence, union-find with a **canonical
minimum representative** is simpler and nearly linear. `StorageSpans` is already
union-find (`span.rs:33`) — but its representative is *not* canonical. `union`
merges by rank (`span.rs:99`) and `span_of` returns whichever node became root,
so the **partition** is stable while the **`SpanId` value** depends on union
order. Anything keying naming or ordering off a `SpanId` inherits that. Taking
the class minimum as the representative closes it.

Every closure gets a property test that shuffles input edge order and requires
the same partition, the same bindings, and byte-identical rendered output.

---

## 5. Honest scope

**Addressed:** `UseInfo` (36 fields); `PreparedSemanticView` (24), partially; the
naming ladder and its 225 sites; undeclared identifiers (property 1); wrong-width
rendering (property 2); rendering determinism (property 3); the elision-versus-
effect confusion (property 4).

**Not addressed, needing separate work:** `CompiledSemanticInfo` (38 fields,
r2sym), `RadareAbi138Accessors` (34, r2source), `ExploreStats` (31),
`EngineTypeWritebackJsonCore` (28), `VmStepSummary` (27). The 13-parameter
functions — `make_ctx`, `insert_structured_memory_access`,
`insert_raw_memory_subeffect`, `from_captured_parts` — which need parameter
objects and splitting. Deep nesting: 440 of 9,844 functions at ≥6 levels, max 12.
`writeback.rs` at 22,006 lines and `native_worker.rs` at 12,667: neither is on the
naming, projection or placement path, and both are deferred.

Thirteen structs sit at ≥20 fields; this plan addresses 2, which are the 2 that
produce rendering defects. No Rust or C function in the repo reaches 20
parameters — the maximum is 13 in Rust and 8 in C.

**Not addressed and not fixed by this rewrite:** `callother` lowering,
sibling-function linking (`sym__rotl32`), and struct typing. They appear in the
open-defect table and must not be counted on any binding-rewrite gate.

---

## 6. Why the corpus is not the specification

`tests/corpus/verify_rendering.py` rewrites the C it verifies:

- one fixed input (`msg`, a single 61-byte string);
- every parameter and every local declaration rewritten to `long`
  (lines 65, 66, 68);
- a width invented for every dereference the rendering left untyped
  (lines 76, 87), counted as `assumed` but not fatal;
- subscripts rewritten to `(((unsigned char *)(long)(X))[Y])`;
- compiled with `clang -w` (line 168), suppressing all warnings.

The consequence is sharper than leniency. **The harness deletes declared types
before compiling**, so it is structurally incapable of observing a value rendered
at the wrong width — which is property 2, the thing most of this work exists to
establish. A transformed success is not proof of emitted-C correctness. Logging
the rewrites is useful; it does not convert a transformed pass into a proof.

Three separate scores replace the single number:

| Score | What it is | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw** | Emitted C compiles with only an external prelude and data mapping — declarations untouched, explicit strict dialect, warnings as errors | Syntax and declared typing |
| **Diagnostic** | The transformed C compiles and runs | The rendering computes something, on one input |
| **Differential** | Behaviour matches the original across empty, boundary-length and randomised inputs and seeds | Semantics, on a distribution |

Warnings-as-errors is necessary and still not sufficient: an explicitly wrong
cast compiles silently. So property 2 has two gates, not one — the compiler is
the **external tripwire**, and the internal invariant that every `UseSite` carries
an exact, upstream-backed projection is the **proof**.

---

## 7. The plan

Eight stages. Each exits on a stated measurement. Corpus numbers are reported at
every gate, up, down or flat — as a signal, never as the gate.

### Stage 0 — Make the raw and differential harness trustworthy

Emit each rendering verbatim to `raw/<config>_<fn>.c` beside the transformed
copy. Add the strict-dialect raw compile and the differential runner. Print, per
file, which rewrites the transformer applied and how many widths it assumed.

**Gate:** all three scores reported per entry. Raw and differential scores exist
for all 54 whether or not they pass. Every transformer rewrite is listed.

### Stage 1 — Define the model, consume nothing

Land `ValueDisposition`, `BindingId`, `Binding`, the initial projection views,
the effect-disposition enum, and the refusal types. No construction, no
consumption. Define the module APIs of `op_lower` and `use_info` in the same
stage, because stage 3 splits behind them. Stage 4 deletes the initial
renderer-owned projection copies after the upstream `MachineProjection` proves
it already owns the exact/refused dense tables; keeping both would violate the
model rather than complete it.

`analysis::use_info::UseAnalysisInput` owns the exact source-analysis seam.
`fold::op_lower::PlannedLoweringInput::try_new` owns the source/plan seam and
rejects an authority mismatch or a `MachineProjection` that does not validate
against that exact source. Neither API is called by the render path in this
stage, and there is still no production `BindingPlan` constructor.

**Gate:** types compile and are unreferenced by the render path. Corpus
byte-identical on all 54 raw outputs.

### Stage 2 — Extend the canonical upstream facts

In `r2il`, `r2sleigh-lift`, and `r2ssa`: give `StorageSpans` a canonical minimum
representative; fold `span::same_run` into `CanonicalStorageId::location()`,
which it duplicates; seal architecture register geometry at the lift boundary;
expose per-`UseSite` slice facts so `UseProjection` is read from upstream rather
than inferred downstream; and record `ZeroExtend` at definitions instead of
consulting `narrow_write_clears_register` at render time. Existing downstream
answers remain temporarily untouched because this is still a non-consuming
stage; they are deleted atomically at the relevant cutover.

**Gate:** every fact `UseProjection` needs is answerable from `r2ssa`/`r2types`
without a renderer table. Shuffle property test passes on the span partition.
Corpus byte-identical on all 54.

### Stage 3 — Split the lowering topology behind the defined APIs

Split `op_lower/mod.rs` (14,401) and `use_info.rs` (12,311) behind the stage-1
facades — moving code, not editing it. This is deliberately a topology-only
split. `UseAnalysisInput` and `PlannedLoweringInput` have the correct authority
shape, but they are not yet mandatory runtime seams: production use analysis
operates on normalized/materialized blocks with additional environment, control,
and prepared-fact inputs, while production lowering enters through `FoldInputs`
and `FoldingContext`. Pretending a mechanical move had sealed those paths would
create a paper invariant. Stage 4 must carry the exact source and plan authority
through those real inputs when it constructs the shadow plan.

`writeback.rs` and `native_worker.rs` are deferred: neither is on an ownership
seam this rewrite touches.

**Gate:** **all 54 raw outputs byte-identical**, not "38 still pass". Tests
retain the exact pre-split behavior. The focused `r2dec` result remains 623
passing with the same three pre-existing failures; the split neither fixes nor
hides them. A single differing raw-output byte means the split was not
mechanical.

### Stage 4 — Shadow construction and divergence classification

Build the value-disposition and binding tables from the existing analysis
without consuming them. Retain one validated upstream `MachineProjection` and
delegate its dense use/write lookups rather than copying their facts. The checked
seal proves exact source authority, machine-projection validity, dense domain
completeness, certificate membership, and one disposition per SSA value before
producing a `BindingPlan`. At the analysis/render boundary, classify each
divergence from the old tables **against canonical upstream evidence** — which of the two is
right, and which upstream fact says so.

The divergence list is *evidence*, not the specification. A divergence where both
sides disagree with upstream is a third finding, not a tie.

Observable-effect outcomes are deliberately not stored in this pre-render plan.
Whether an effect rendered is knowable only after folding and final AST/ledger
reconciliation; copying that answer backward into a future lowering input would
be temporal circularity. Stage 4 records only the honest legacy observations
available today: graph literals are inline, while nonconstant values, uses, and
writes are `LegacyAbsent`. The old renderer has neither an authority-sealed
value-decision journal nor stable original use/write identities after
normalization. Inventing those answers from names would make the shadow result
look complete by repeating the defect it is meant to expose. The decision
journal lands after normalized origins in stage 5; the canonical effect ledger
cuts over in stage 7.

The shadow oracle is constructed independently from the candidate plan: it
reseals the exact source artifact, builds a fresh machine projection, and derives
certificate components with its own traversal. The report then re-derives and
validates every stored observation and count. Its public audit ledger exposes
the three domain equations and refusal total rather than caching a pass bit.
Construction occurs only after code generation and the historical final work
poll, so it cannot change rendered C or cancellation/deadline decisions.

**Gate:** independently enumerate every canonical `ValueId`, every graph-input
`UseSite`, and every output-producing `InstId`; the observed and classified
counts must equal those three domain counts. Every non-agreement is classified
as old-wrong, shadow-wrong, or both-wrong with a typed upstream evidence key,
including equal-but-both-wrong cases. The gate requires
`shadow_wrong = both_wrong = unclassified = 0` and `refused = 0`. A typed
canonical refusal remains visible in the ledger, but it is a non-quality result,
never a pass. The seal must be valid, and a non-empty source must produce a
non-empty domain. Corpus raw output remains byte-identical on all 54 — nothing
consumes the plan yet, so any change means something does; find it.

### Stage 5 — Cut over naming, delete the naming tables

`ValueDisposition::Bound` becomes the only source of an identifier. Delete
`carrier_alias`, `var_alias`, `param_alias` and the ladder ordering them, in the
same change as the cutover — not a stage later.

The cutover first replaces `MaterializedEdgeCopies` with a sealed normalization
artifact whose block-aligned origin rows move with every inserted or removed op.
An inserted phi-edge copy names its original phi definition and incoming
`UseSite`; a guarded edge also records the original guard use and identifies its
synthetic preserve operand as synthetic; a relocated certified initializer
records the complete sorted set of phi uses it replaces. These are transformation
origins, not new semantic identities. The current tuple `HashSet<(block, dst,
src)>` loses those facts and can collapse distinct occurrences, so it cannot
authorize the cutover. Where the upstream loop-carrier edge contract does not
retain the exact phi-input `UseSite`, extend that contract in `r2ssa`; `r2dec`
must not recover it from a predecessor/value pair.

Once those origins are sealed, add an authority-bound legacy observation journal
at the points where the old renderer actually binds, inlines, elides, or refuses
each value/use/write obligation. Initialize the full dense V/U/W domain, accept
only idempotent duplicate decisions, reject conflicts, and seal after final AST
materialization. Binding equivalence comes from complete sorted `ValueId` member
sets, never from emitted names or symbol-allocation order. This journal is the
last comparison oracle for the naming cutover; it is not a second renderer
contract.

Expect a regression. A measured regression here is how far the rewrite still has
to go, not grounds for reverting it.

**Gate:** ledger balances — `rendered + justified_elision + refused = total`,
`unaccounted = 0` — on all 54. `refused` reported as failure. Corpus reported
honestly, whatever it is.

### Stage 6 — Cut over per-use projection, delete the width aliases

Every `UseSite` renders through its canonical `MachineUseDisposition`. Delete
the width and member-view aliases in the same change.

**Gate:** raw score compiles under strict dialect with warnings as errors, on
every entry that renders. Every `UseSite` has an upstream-backed projection —
zero inferred. Both gates, not either.

### Stage 7 — Cut over placement, inlining, elision, and the effect ledger

Placement becomes the pure lowering phase over a sealed structured-region
artifact. Because the current structurer discards `Region`, retaining and
sealing that artifact is the first part of this stage, not a renderer-side
placement cache.
`InlineProof` and `DeadValueProof` become required. The effect ledger lands
separately from the value ledger.

**Gate:** every surviving read is dominated by its declaration and preceded by an
assignment on every path, or the binding is a `PlacementRefusal`. No effectful
obligation elided for want of readers. Differential score reported across all
input classes.

---

## 8. Fastest path

- **Stage 0 first.** Every later stage is measured through the harness, and the
  current one cannot see property 2 at all. Two turns were lost once to a cast the
  harness itself inserted; one regex slip (`__?u?int` for `(?:__)?u?int`) moved
  the corpus 37 → 18 with no decompiler change.
- **Stage 1 before stage 3.** Splitting along an API that does not exist yet is
  how you split along the wrong seam. Define, then split.
- **Stage 2 before stage 4.** Divergences are classified against upstream
  evidence, so the evidence has to be answerable first, or the classification
  degrades into preferring whichever table is newer.
- **Delete at cutover, never later.** A stage that leaves the old table in place
  leaves two answerers, which is the defect.
- **Do not chase the open corpus failures before stage 5.** The name and width
  families dissolve in stages 5 and 6. Fixing them individually first means
  fixing them twice — and three of the six inert fixes were exactly that.
- **Deferred and unblocking:** `writeback.rs`, `native_worker.rs`, the
  13-parameter functions, deep nesting, clippy, fmt. Any time. Not instead of a
  stage.

## 9. Rules of engagement

1. **Trace before the guard.** A value has several tables that can answer for it.
   Suppressing one is indistinguishable from a wrong fix while another answers.
2. **A change that alters no rendered output does not stay in the tree.** It
   proves nothing. This does *not* apply to a change that restructures a blocking
   seam and costs corpus results on the way; that is progress with a price.
3. **Never trust a corpus number without confirming the install.** `make -C
   r2plugin install` must print `Installed to ...`. A failed install silently
   leaves the old plugin and reads exactly like a regression.
4. **Check `df` at the first `codesign` failure.** Roughly 40 codesign errors and
   two false readings had one cause: a full disk from a 69 GB `target/debug` in a
   release-only workflow.
5. **When a number moves and it should not have, stop.** The regex slip was caught
   only because 37 → 18 was impossible for the change made.
6. **The 2340 tests caught none of this branch's defects.** They are a regression
   net. The invariants in section 4 and the ledger in section 4 are what tests can
   actually assert.
7. **A refusal is a failure, not a pass.** Satisfying a checker by declining to
   answer is the same shape as the reverted pass that satisfied the undefined-name
   detector by declaring the undefined names.

## 10. Open defects at the stage-0 baseline

The harness now accounts for every cell. Failure status and causal diagnosis
remain separate: a cell is never omitted merely because its root cause has not
yet been classified.

| Configuration | Generation | Raw | Diagnostic | Differential |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| x64 O0 | 9 present | 9 signature mismatch | 9 signature mismatch | 9 blocked |
| x64 O1 | 9 present | 9 signature mismatch | 9 signature mismatch | 9 blocked |
| x64 O2 | 8 present, 1 renderer error | 8 signature mismatch, 1 blocked | 8 signature mismatch, 1 blocked | 9 blocked |
| arm64 O0 | 9 present | 9 compile failure | 7 pass, 2 failure | 7 diagnostic-backed pass, 2 blocked |
| arm64 O1 | 9 present | 8 compile failure, 1 signature mismatch | 7 pass, 1 failure, 1 signature mismatch | 7 diagnostic-backed pass, 2 blocked |
| arm64 O2 | 9 present | 9 compile failure | 6 pass, 3 failure | 6 diagnostic-backed pass, 3 blocked |

Known causal examples remain useful for routing, not accounting:

| Cause | Cleared by |
|---|---|
| x64 parameter/signature over-recovery | Stage 5 and upstream type projection |
| murmur3 merge values read before declaration | Stages 5 and 7 |
| crc32_bitwise undeclared register piece/alias values | Stage 5 |
| fnv1a64 narrow/wide piece composition | Stage 6 |
| xxhash32 unresolved rotate, `callother`, and struct typing | Separate upstream semantic/type work where the binding rewrite supplies no proof |

## 10b. Measured state at 21d961e

Seven fixes landed since the stage-0 baseline, each traced to its source before
any code was written. Three further changes were measured inert and reverted;
five hypotheses were disproven by trace before code.

| | baseline | now |
|---|---:|---:|
| workspace tests | 2236 pass / 2 fail | 2238 pass / 0 fail |
| generation present | 7 of 54 | 8 of 54 |
| raw / diagnostic / differential | 0 of 54 | 0 of 54 |
| placement audit refused | 33 | 5 |
| placement audit passed | 7 | 27 |
| binding audit failed | 41 | 27 |
| binding audit passed | 7 | 21 |
| raw errors that are not the signature check | 30 | 20 |

Refusal classes cleared outright: `region_does_not_dominate_occurrence` (18),
`read_before_assignment` (18), `ambiguous_observation_execution_order` (6),
`label followed by a declaration` (12 compiler errors), and the 41 cells whose
refusal named an authority that had not failed.

### What each fix was

- `33db0ba` The install guard used `rg`, which is absent from a plain shell, so
  every measurement aborted after a successful install. Separately, three sites
  collapsed typed journal failures into a machine-projection refusal, so 41 of 47
  cells were filed against the wrong authority.
- `9cc6cc5` Live-out matched the full `CanonicalStorageId` of a return slot, so a
  value composed by `xor eax, eax` and `sete al` was seen only as the zero, and
  `recover_interface` recovered no parameters at all.
- `0ebb565` A placement refusal was computed, held aside, and reported only after
  the seal it had caused, so the seal's symptom hid it.
- `11e3530` Normalization materializes a phi as one copy per incoming edge, and
  placement took each copy's block from the original phi rather than from the
  predecessor the copy lives in.
- `d19a77a` `BindingRole` had no name for a caller-supplied value outside the
  convention's argument slots, so placement demanded an assignment for a value
  the caller had already supplied.
- `d8eafa5` A stack assignment's target is an lvalue whose address reads are
  ordered against its own store; treating them as unsequenced operands marked
  six functions ambiguous.
- `21d961e` A label must be followed by a statement, so an inline declaration
  cannot be placed there.

### What the raw score asserts, and what it does not

The raw runner used to assert that the emitted function had exactly the source's
parameter and return types, which `mint_recovered_interface` documents it never
claims: a parameter is an unsigned integer of the register's own width, and
signedness, pointer-ness and names are erased by compilation. No decompiler
change could satisfy that, and all eight generating cells failed on it before
reaching a real defect.

Raw now calls the function through the signature the rendering itself declares,
converting the data pointer as an integer of the declared width. What it proves
is unchanged and still strict: the emitted C compiles under warnings-as-errors
with its declarations untouched, and runs.

The comparison was not discarded. Each entry carries a `typed_recovery` record
with the declared and expected types and whether they agree, reported and never
gating, so it remains a visible target of its own. All eight cells record
`parameters_match: false` today: every one renders
`uint64_t (int64_t, int64_t)` where the source is
`uint32_t (const uint8_t *, size_t)`.

### The remaining twenty errors, by owning file

| Error | Cells | Owner |
|---|---:|---|
| `implicit conversion changes signedness` | 6 | `type_from_size` call sites in `r2dec/fold/op_lower/implementation.rs` |
| unused variable / set-but-not-used | 13 | a value whose readers the fold deleted stays `Bound`; needs transitive dead-value analysis, `r2ssa/semantic.rs` and the fold |
| `unused label` | 1 | a label minted with no `goto` reaching it, `r2dec/structure.rs` |

Two further classes sit behind the same files. Eight `rendered_value_required`
cells are the AArch64 link register bound as a program object: no stack-frame
round trip is certified for it because `collect_callee_stack_allocation_certificates`
yields no allocations on AArch64, so the collector's body never runs. Nineteen
`non_quality` cells are effect-obligation refusals where a removed phi's
`LoopCarriedState` and `LiveValueProducer` obligations are refused
`BlockNotRendered`: the state is carried by the materialized edge copies, but no
`ElisionReason` names that, and letting each of N copies claim the obligation
would report a duplicate occurrence instead. That ownership question is the
stage-7 effect-ledger cutover.

### Attribution of the first five fixes

`33db0ba`, `9cc6cc5`, `0ebb565`, `11e3530` and `d19a77a` were staged with
`git add <file>` on files that already carried uncommitted work from a
concurrent session in this worktree, so each of those commits also contains
several hundred lines that session wrote. The work is intact on the branch and
the tree builds and tests green, but those commit messages describe only the
part authored under them. `0ebb565` and `11e3530` are the largest cases, at
roughly 500 and 430 lines respectively.

The history is deliberately left as it is rather than rewritten, because the
other session is still building on this branch and rewriting five commits
underneath it would be the worse outcome. Every commit from `d8eafa5` onward was
staged file by file with the staged diff checked before committing.

### The unused-variable class, and three attempts that failed

Thirteen of the raw errors are declarations no statement reads --
`uint32_t tmp_11f00_3 = stack_m28;` in djb2 is the shape. The values have
exactly one graph use, and the machine disposition of that use is `Exact`, so
the plan says it renders. What actually happens is that the load feeds a
condition code nothing reads: `ValueId(223)` is consumed only by an `IntCarry`
whose output is already `Elided { UnobservedValue }`.

Three attempts were measured and all three reverted.

**Marking the value elided in the plan.** A fixpoint over dispositions -- a
value every use of which feeds an elided value is elided -- fires correctly and
marks both loads. The emitted C is byte-identical. The reason is an ordering
bug in the attempt itself: `binding_components` recomputes eligibility from a
vector captured before the fixpoint and then assigns `Bound` over the result.
Anything that sets a disposition before components are built is overwritten.

**Making the fold consult the plan.** `lower_op` does see these operations in
statement mode with the right `ValueId`s, so a guard there is well placed. It
was inert only because the disposition it read had been overwritten as above.
Worth knowing regardless: the fold consults `ValueDisposition` at no call site
anywhere under `crates/r2dec/src/fold/`, so the plan can mark a value elided and
the renderer will still emit it, and the journal does not object.

**Closing eligibility over dead uses.** Widening the ineligibility set instead,
so components never form, regresses badly: generation falls from eight functions
to three seeded from raw ineligibility, and to four when seeded only from the
unobserved and structural-unused reasons. The premise is unsound. An unobserved
*output* does not mean its operands are unrendered -- a loop carrier's merge can
be unobserved while the update feeding it is genuinely rendered -- so "every use
feeds something unobserved" does not imply dead.

**Excluding the value from the binding domain at all.** Restricting the closure
to flag consumers -- a register-spaced output of a single byte, which a carrier
merge can never be -- is sound where the broader rules were not, and it does
remove the unused variables. It still regresses: generation falls from eight
functions to five, and djb2, sdbm and adler32 refuse with
`missing_program_variable_authorization`.

That refusal is the answer the four attempts were circling. The fold does not
skip a value it has no binding for; it *demands* one.
`analysis::lower::LowerCtx::bound_program_symbol` maps
`PlannedValueSymbol::Elided` onto `MissingProgramVariableAuthorization`, while
the `require_value` it calls documents the opposite in its own comment: "Inline
and elided values are successful answers: neither authorizes a C program
variable, but both are complete plan dispositions." One of the two is wrong, and
it is the caller.

So the order is fixed, and it is the reverse of what all four attempts assumed.
The fold has to gain a no-emit path first -- `bound_program_symbol` returning
"this value has no rendered occurrence" rather than a refusal, threaded out
through `var_name` and `assignment_lhs_expr` to the `LoweredOp::None` that
`lower_op` already has -- and only then can the plan stop binding the value.
Removing the binding first is what every one of these attempts did, and it is
why every one of them failed. `analysis/lower.rs` is not held by the concurrent
session.

**The fifth attempt narrows it once more.** Marking the flag-only values
`Elided { DeadFlagOnly }` -- a successful plan answer rather than the
placeholder refusal -- and adding the `lower_op` guard so their definitions are
never lowered still leaves djb2, sdbm and adler32 refusing
`missing_program_variable_authorization`. The demand does not come from lowering
the dead value's own definition at all. It comes from lowering the *flag
operation*, which is still emitted and resolves its operands, and operand
resolution runs in `LowerMode::Expr` where the statement-mode guard never fires.

So the no-emit path has to cover the consumer as well as the definition: an
operation whose output the plan elided must not be lowered in either mode, and
its operands must never be demanded. Five attempts have each removed one more
reason the value is still reached; this is the sixth and it is the one that
decides whether the approach works at all.

### Attempts six and seven, and what to do instead

Guarding both lowering modes leaves the plan build itself failing, and
`R2SLEIGH_DEBUG_UNOWNED` names it exactly:
`Seal(InvalidElisionProof { value: ValueId(223) })`. The sealing oracle
re-derives every elision reason independently and `DeadFlagOnly` had no arm.
Adding one lets the plan build and moves the refusal on to
`exact_use_requires_rendered_occurrence`. Eliding the uses and writes of
unrendered values in turn takes generation from eight functions to zero.

Three pieces are worth keeping when someone returns to this. Narrowing
eligibility to flag consumers -- a register-spaced output of a single byte,
which a loop carrier's merge can never be -- is sound and does remove the unused
variables. The `DeadFlagOnly` arm in the seal's proof validator is correct and
required. The `lower_op` guard is in the right place.

What is not understood is how many consumers still demand these values. Seven
attempts each found exactly one more, serially, at a build and corpus cycle
apiece, and the last showed the failure is not monotonic: three functions
regressing became nothing rendering in a single step. The next attempt should
enumerate rather than iterate -- instrument every producer of
`MissingProgramVariableAuthorization` and
`exact_use_requires_rendered_occurrence` at once and take the whole list in one
run before changing anything.

That enumeration has now been taken, and it settles the question.
`MissingProgramVariableAuthorization` has sixty-two producers across nine files
-- twenty-four in `analysis/lower.rs`, fourteen in `op_lower/implementation.rs`,
nine in `lib.rs`, four in `op_lower/lowering.rs`, three each in
`op_lower/calls.rs` and `analysis/prepared_semantic.rs`, two each in
`op_lower/memory_renderer.rs` and `structure.rs`, and one in `fold/stack.rs` --
and `ExactUseRequiresRenderedOccurrence` adds nine more.

Every one of them is a site that demands a program variable for a value. Making
a value non-bound turns each into a potential refusal, which is exactly why
seven serial attempts each discovered precisely one more consumer. There is no
short chain to walk to its end. Giving the renderer a no-emit path is a contract
change over roughly seventy demand sites, four of the nine files belong to a
concurrent session, and it is the stage-5 naming cutover in full rather than a
defect that can be fixed.

### The four smaller refusal classes, traced

Nineteen refusals sat in four classes that had never been looked at. They
resolve into two families and one unknown.

**Eight are the dead-value class again.** Six
`exact_write_requires_rendered_occurrence` and two
`exact_use_requires_rendered_occurrence` are a write or a use whose machine
disposition is `Exact` and for which no occurrence was rendered -- the same
disagreement between the plan and the renderer described above, seen from the
use and write ledgers instead of the value ledger. They are gated by the same
seventy-site cutover.

**Five are the narrow-write projection.**
`preserved_carrier_read_before_assignment` is
`PlacementRefusal::ReadBeforeAssignment` where the read is a
`PlacementRead::PreservedCarrierWrite`: the implied read of the bytes a partial
write preserves, occurring before the binding is ever assigned. On x86-64 a
32-bit register write clears the upper half, so there is no preserved read at
all and the projection should be `ZeroExtend` rather than `Insert`. That
decision lives in `r2ssa::machine::exact_zero_extend_write`, which the
concurrent session is extending -- `machine.rs` carries 176 uncommitted lines
including a second zero-extend path inserted directly after it.

**Two are unknown.** `missing_machine_projection_authorization` on
`crc32_bitwise` and `xxhash32` at AArch64 -O2 report a null cause and need a
probe.

So of the fifty-four cells, everything except those two is now traced to a named
cause, and every remaining fix lands either in the seventy-site cutover or in a
file the concurrent session holds.

### A note on the machine-role coordinate system

`SourceMachineRoles` storages arrive from radare2's register profile
(`libr/anal/function.c`, `*offset = item->offset / 8`) while graph storages are
Sleigh varnode offsets: on AArch64 the captured return-address role reports
offset 0 where `x0` is 16384 and `x30` is 16624. Both are tagged
`CanonicalStorageSpace::Register`, so the type asserts they are comparable when
they are not. Nothing has broken because every existing comparison is
capture-against-capture. Any question of the form "is this graph value the
machine's return address" needs a translation that does not exist: the wire
carries `name_length` but no name, and radare2's public view struct has no name
field either.

## 11. The durable statement

> One canonical location per machine place, one certified span per uninterrupted
> content, one disposition per SSA value, one binding per rendered C object, and
> one projection per use.

Four of those five already exist upstream. The rewrite is mostly a matter of
letting the renderer read them instead of re-deriving them — and of deleting what
it used to re-derive them with, in the same change that stops using it.

## What is left, and exactly where it lives

Raw errors are down to two. Everything else was traced to a cause and fixed
there. What follows is the state after that, with the measurement behind each
claim.

### The scores

Generation 15, raw 14, diagnostic 12, differential 12, of 54.

Generation is deliberately below raw. It counts cells that produced a
rendering, and eleven of them were producing C that does not compile while
reporting it as rendered. The undeclared-name check now resolves a name
against the scope that has to declare it rather than against the function as a
whole, so those cells refuse instead. Raw, diagnostic and differential did not
move when that landed, because none of those functions was compiling anyway.

A cell that renders and a cell that compiles are now much closer to the same
thing, which is the direction that matters. Generation rises again when the
loop shape below is fixed.

### A do-while condition reads a name declared inside its own body

`structure.rs`'s `Region::DoWhileLoop` takes its condition expression from
`get_branch_condition_with_predicate(cond_block)` and separately flattens that
block's *statements* into the loop body. When the condition is a temporary the
block computes, the declaration lands inside the braces and the read lands in
the `while (...)`, which in C is not in that scope.

The fix belongs there: either the condition block's statements stay with the
condition, or the loop is emitted as `while (1) { body; if (!cond) break; }` so
the computation and its use share a scope. Repairing the scope downstream --
hoisting the declaration out after the fact -- would be compensating at the
symptom, and the AST node would still be one C cannot express.

This is not edited here because the concurrent session is rewriting that exact
call: its diff changes `observe_control_ownership(*cond_block, CStmt::DoWhile
{ ... })` into `observe_loop_control_ownership(loop_id, *cond_block,
CStmt::DoWhile { ... })`, which is the expression that would have to change.

Eleven generation cells.

### `xor r, r` reads the register it does not depend on

`crc32_bitwise` on x64 emits `EAX_0 = EAX_0 ^ EAX_0`. `EAX_0` is correctly an
`EntryValue` -- version zero with no defining instruction -- so it is declared
without an initializer, and reading it is what the machine does. A strict
compile rejects it.

The identity that removes it already exists: `simplify_op` folds `IntXor` with
`a == b` to zero. It does not run, because `DecompilePrepConfig` disables
`enable_inst_combine` on the decompile path.

Enabling it was measured: raw 14 to 16, and `adler32/arm64_O0` stops rendering,
taking differential 12 to 11. The refusal is `missing machine projection
authorization` from `certified_memory_access_expr` in
`fold/op_lower/memory_renderer.rs`, which requires `fact.address == address`.
The certified memory-access facts are keyed on the `ValueId`s the address
computation had *before* prep ran, so any prep pass that rewrites that
computation invalidates the certificate that authorizes it. The flag is not the
defect; the ordering is.

Fixing it means deriving those certificates after prep, or carrying them across
it -- which is `semantic.rs`, also the concurrent session's. Until then the
flag stays off, because trading a differential cell for two raw cells is the
wrong direction.

The two remaining raw errors.

## Architecture work: what was done and what it cost

All four architecture items are settled. Three needed a change, one turned
out not to exist, and two of the four were diagnosed wrongly first -- both
times by reasoning from the symptom instead of tracing the value.

### A1. A declaration the read cannot see

Diagnosed first as a structurer defect: `Region::DoWhileLoop` flattens its
condition block's statements into the body while the condition expression
stays outside, so a temporary the body declares is read out of scope. The
proposed fix was to reshape the loop into `while (1) { body; if (!cond) break; }`.

That was wrong. Tracing the binding rather than the symptom showed the
condition temporary is a plan binding carrying an `Inline` decision, and
inlining is what moves its declaration into the body. The loop shape never
had to change.

Whether an inline is expressible is a fact about the emitted tree, not about
the occurrence set the decisions were derived from, so the tree is asked:
apply, check that every name is declared in a scope that dominates its reads,
and demote any inline the check reports to the lexical declaration it now
carries as a fallback. A demotion only ever turns an inline into a
declaration, so it terminates.

Generation 15 to 26, raw 14 to 22, diagnostic and differential 12 to 20.

### A2. A constant is a boolean

Diagnosed first as certificates keyed on pre-prep value ids, invalidated by
any pass that renumbers. Also wrong: certificates are already collected after
prep, and every memory-access fact matched its site exactly when traced.

The real blocker was `value_has_boolean_producer`, which decides whether a
value may be interned as a boolean by walking back to a producing comparison.
Folding `0xfff1 == 0` replaces that comparison with a `Copy` of a constant,
and a constant has no defining instruction, so the walk concluded the value
had never been boolean and refused every use of the select reading it -- the
divide-by-zero guard Sleigh emits around a division. A constant zero or one
is a boolean; constant folding a comparison is exactly how a boolean becomes
one.

With that fixed, `enable_inst_combine` could be turned on for the decompile
path, which is what removes `EAX_0 = EAX_0 ^ EAX_0` -- an uninitialised read
of an entry value that no internal check refuses, and the deliberate hole in
property 1's second half.

Raw 22 to 27, raw errors 4 to 0. Every function that renders now compiles
under a strict dialect with warnings fatal.

### A3. Not needed

Structural control ownership was to be made visible at the seal so that a
`BranchInd` rendered as a switch could state the elision of its target
operand. Enabling `inst_combine` removed the two cells that motivated it.

The architectural gap is real -- nothing the journal holds records that the
structure took ownership of a transfer -- but there is no failing case, and
writing the mechanism ahead of a trace is the exact move this project's
history warns against. It is recorded here and left unbuilt.

### A4. Determinism, proved rather than asserted

Property 3 had one `shuffle` reference in the tree. It now has a property
test that renders one function from two orderings of its input blocks and
requires byte-identical output, with the entry block held first because the
first block is what defines the entry.

Nothing was found to fix. The corpus repeat comparison is the stronger
probe and it agrees: all fifty-four cells are byte-identical across two
separate runs. That is decisive rather than merely encouraging, because
Rust seeds each process's hash maps differently, so any hash iteration
order reaching the output would have diverged between the two processes.

### Where the properties stand

Property 1 is enforced, both halves: the dominating-scope check drives
placement's own inline decision, and the uninitialised entry read it could
not refuse is now never generated. Property 2 is tripwired by the raw gate,
which is at zero errors. Property 3 has a test and passes it. Property 4 was
already enforced, and is the check that caught every regression made against
this branch.

## Redesign: one stack coordinate system, and identity we prove ourselves

Nine cells refuse with `missing program-variable authorization`. The refusal is
retained in `fold/stack.rs` when `require_stack` fails, the reason is
`MissingSourceIdentity`, and the object it names is an ordinary local. What
follows is why that happens, and what to build instead.

### What is there now

Stack addresses are tracked as roots in two parallel maps.
`stack_address_roots` allows either base; `entry_stack_address_roots` allows
only the stack pointer. Every arm of the propagation fixpoint is written twice,
once per map, differing in a size gate and in one call -- about two hundred and
forty lines in which each operation is handled two ways.

The one call is `rebase_declared_frame_pointer`, which resets a declared frame
pointer's root to `(FramePointer, 0)`. After `push rbp; mov rbp, rsp` the frame
pointer genuinely *is* the entry stack pointer less eight, and this discards
that. From then on there are two coordinate systems for the same addresses with
no way to compare them, and `record_entry_stack_root` treats two spellings of
one slot as a contradiction: it deletes the root and marks the object
permanently ambiguous.

Separately, an object's size and identity are taken from radare2's declared
slot table, with a callee-allocation certificate as the only fallback. When
neither answers, `size` is `None`, the object has no identity, and every use of
it refuses the whole function.

### What the measurements say

Removing the rebase was tried and is measured neutral: generation, raw,
diagnostic and differential all stay at 29. It is not sufficient on its own, so
the coordinate split is the smaller half of the problem.

The larger half is that identity is outsourced. `murmur3_32` at -O0 has fourteen
stack objects and radare2 reports no stack variables at all for it -- `afvj`
returns only two register arguments. `fnv1a32`, which renders, gets its objects
from callee-allocation certificates instead, and those succeed there only
because it is a leaf function with no explicit frame allocation.

This is the same failure as the parameter that was dropped earlier today, where
radare2 counted a register the function writes without reading. An external
opinion is being used for something the analysis can prove.

### What to build

One coordinate system. Every stack address root is expressed relative to the
entry stack pointer. The frame pointer stops being a base and becomes an
ordinary value whose root is `(entry stack pointer, -k)`, learned from the copy
that establishes it. `StackAddressBase::FramePointer` survives only as the form
radare2's declared slots arrive in, converted into our coordinates at ingest.

One root map, and the duplicated arms collapse into it.

Identity derived from the object's own accesses. An object accessed at a
consistent width through a proven entry-relative address is a stack object of
that size, and that is a positive fact about the program. Radare2's slot table
becomes a naming and typing hint, never the source of identity, and
`MissingSourceIdentity` comes to mean that the analysis could not prove a
location rather than that radare2 was silent.

### Stages, each with a gate

The order below is not the obvious one, and the reason is worth stating because
the obvious order was tried first and is wrong.

Convert declared frame-pointer slots into entry-relative coordinates at ingest,
so that every internal root is stack-pointer-relative and a base is no longer
part of an object's identity. The gate is generation at or above twenty-nine.

Then derive the size from the accesses when no declared slot answers. The gate
is that no differential cell is lost.

Then collapse the two root maps and delete `rebase_declared_frame_pointer`. The
gate is that the rendering of the passing cells is byte-identical, which the
determinism property test is already able to check.

### Why the width cannot be derived first

Deriving the width first was implemented and reverted. It works -- the objects
of `murmur3_32` acquire widths of eight and four, the refusal moves from
`missing program-variable authorization` to a later machine-projection one, and
the object at entry offset zero correctly keeps no width because it is the
return address and no access agrees on a width for it.

It also breaks `memory_ssa_separates_saved_sp_slot_from_frame_relative_local`,
which exists to keep two objects apart: a saved stack-pointer slot at
`(StackPointer, -8)` and a frame-relative local at `(FramePointer, -8)`. Same
offset, different base, genuinely different places. Its assertion says that an
uncaptured stack resource must not borrow another coordinate's width, and
deriving from accesses does exactly that while two bases are still in play.

Requiring the object's coordinate to be captured is not enough to satisfy it,
because both of those objects have captured coordinates. The bases are what
distinguish them, so the width may only be derived once a base is no longer how
two objects are told apart -- which is the first stage, not this one.

The test is the design speaking. In a unified coordinate system those two
objects are distinguished by their true entry-relative offsets, the saved slot
at entry minus eight and the local at entry minus eight minus the frame size,
and no base is needed to separate them.

Everything stack-related depends on this, so the corpus will move before it
settles. That is expected, and it is why each stage has a gate rather than one
measurement at the end.

# Revision 3: finishing the rewrite

Revision 2 described the model and eight stages. Stages 0, 1, 3 and most of 7
landed, and the corpus became honest -- generation, raw, diagnostic and
differential all agree, with no raw errors and nothing rendered wrong. The
central defect of section 3 was reduced and not removed, and property 2's
internal half was never established.

This revision says what remains and when it is finished. It is written because
a partial rewrite is worse than no rewrite: the tree then carries both the old
shape and the new one, and every later change has to satisfy both.

## What done means

All four properties of section 1 proved by their stated method, the section 3
defect removed, and the corpus at parity across optimization levels: every one
of the fifty-four cells rendering, with generation, raw, diagnostic and
differential equal.

Parity at -O2 needs work revision 2 explicitly excluded -- `callother`
lowering, sibling-function linking, struct typing. Those are carried here as
their own track rather than folded into the rewrite, because they are separate
defects that happen to stand between us and the same number.

## Track A -- remove the many answerers

`UseInfo` is thirty-one fields. Several are one fact keyed several ways, each
independently writable: `value_ids_by_var` against `value_ids_by_name` against
`vars_by_value_id`; the ambiguity set under three key types;
`definitions_by_value` against `formatted_defs`; `stable_memory_values` against
`stable_memory_values_by_value`. `unkeyed_writes` counts the drift between two
of them and still ships.

**A1.** Classify every field: answerable upstream, derivable from another
field, or a genuinely stored fact with one writer. *Gate:* every field
classified, each naming the upstream fact or the field it derives from.

**A2.** Delete the string-keyed half and the drift counter it measures.
*Gate:* ledger balances on all fifty-four; corpus reported, never gating.

**A3.** Collapse each multi-directional relation to one stored direction with
derived accessors. *Gate:* no field is written by more than one pass.

**A4.** Delete the alias ladder -- `carrier_alias`, `var_alias`,
`param_alias` -- in the same change that stops reading it. *Gate:* one source
of an identifier, which is `ValueDisposition::Bound`.

## Track B -- make inference unrepresentable

Property 2 has two gates and only the external one holds. `cast_expr_if_needed`
infers an operand type from a hint and drops it when the hint is absent, which
is how the sign flag came to be compared as unsigned and `crc32_bitwise`
returned a CRC of nothing while compiling cleanly.

**B1.** A cast on the render path cannot be constructed without a projection
that only the upstream fact layer can make. The compiler then enumerates every
inferred site, exactly as it enumerated every unrecorded refusal. *Gate:* it
compiles, and the enumeration is the work list.

**B2.** Convert each site to carry its projection, or refuse where upstream
has no fact to carry. *Gate:* zero inferred casts on the render path; raw stays
at zero errors.

## Track C -- finish what was started

**C1.** Definitions classified `Insert` that are narrow writes clearing their
carrier should be `ZeroExtend`. This is revision 2's stage 2, left unfinished.
*Gate:* the five `preserved_carrier_read_before_assignment` cells resolve or
name a different cause.

**C2.** Collapse `stack_address_roots` and `entry_stack_address_roots` into one
map and delete `rebase_declared_frame_pointer`. *Gate:* rendering of passing
cells byte-identical, which the determinism test can check.

**C3.** Binding components stay derived twice, because the independence is a
cross-check rather than a copy. Each *rule* moves to one place both derivations
call, so they cannot drift on a rule while still checking each other's result.
*Gate:* no rule stated twice; the seal still rejects a plan whose components
disagree.

## Track D -- the corpus to parity

**D1.** Clear the remaining refusal classes, largest first, each traced to a
cause before any change.

**D2.** The named analysis gaps: call-result facts for an unresolved external
callee, `callother` lowering, sibling-function linking, struct typing.

*Gate:* fifty-four of fifty-four, with generation, raw, diagnostic and
differential equal, and O0, O1 and O2 at parity.

## Order, and why

A and B first. Revision 2's section 8 says not to chase corpus failures before
the naming and width families dissolve, because fixing them individually means
fixing them twice, and three of six inert fixes were exactly that. That
reasoning has not changed. C runs alongside, since each item is independent. D
last.

Expect the corpus to fall during A and B. It is a canary, and the ledger is the
instrument: `rendered + justified_elision + refused = total`, `unaccounted = 0`,
`defects = 0` on accepted output. A fall with the ledger balanced is the rewrite
working; a rise with it unbalanced is the rewrite being cheated.

## Revision 4 -- what the tracks found when they were run

Tracks A through D were written from a reading of the code. Running them
changed what several of them are about, and the corrections are worth more than
the original statements, so they are recorded here rather than edited in above.

### Track A: most of it was unread, and one part of it was refusing

A1's classification found six `UseInfo` fields with no reader at all, and the
whole name-keyed identity -- `value_ids_by_name`, `ambiguous_value_names`, and
a `value_id_for_name_or_bind` that minted `ValueId(9500 + len)` for any
spelling that had none -- reachable only from the lowering tests. That last
part was not merely unused but inert: a minted identity is written to the
name-keyed map while every lookup that matters goes through `value_ids_by_var`,
which the fixtures never seeded. Deleting the seeding entirely left every test
passing, which says the fixtures had been running against an empty `UseInfo`.

Two findings from A were not anticipated by it.

The first is that a deleted table can keep refusing. `merge_prepared_stack_slot`
lost its destination field and still reported a dropped fact whenever a slot had
no value identity, and that report is read at the lowering catch-all to refuse
the function. A refusal on behalf of a table that no longer exists is not
conservative, it is false, and nothing about the deletion made it visible. Any
further field deletion has to check for this shape: the writer that survives its
table and reports the loss.

The second is that `definitions_by_value` was not a field to be collapsed but
the output of a second renderer. `analysis/lower.rs` held a complete duplicate
lowering of every SSA operation into a C expression, with its own operand
resolution, its own cast rules and its own type-from-width helpers, and its
results went into that map. Nothing read them. Making the accessor return
`None` unconditionally left all fifty-four cells byte-identical, so the only
consumer of a definition the ladder produced was the ladder itself, resolving
its own operands. It is gone, 2042 lines, and with it `PassEnv`, five
`FoldArchConfig` fields, `FoldInputs::display_names` and `FoldInputs::strings`.

### Track B is smaller than five clusters, and points somewhere else

One of B's five clusters of inferred casts, the `TypeOracle` channel, was
reachable only from that ladder. `SourceEvidenceTypeOracle` was constructed on
every native render and handed to the fold, and the fold's only reader was the
duplicate lowering. Deleting the ladder retired the cluster.

B1's actual proposal -- make `cast_needed` refuse when it has no source type --
was traced and is not yet the right first move. Its blast radius is every
arithmetic and comparison operation whose destination has a certified type, and
a refusal there aborts the whole function, so it would convert a large number of
renders into refusals before any of them could be given a source to carry.

The trace turned up something more direct. Every binding is declared with
`Binding::declaration_type`, which is always `CType::machine_bits(width)` --
unsigned. The cast policy compares against `type_hint_for_var`, which reports
what upstream proved the value *means*: signed, a pointer, a typedef. These are
two answerers for one value's type, and only one of them is about the program
the compiler reads. A value declared `uint32_t` and believed `int32_t` gets no
cast at all, because target and source compare equal, and the emitted expression
is then unsigned. That is the shape of the sign-flag defect that made
`crc32_bitwise` return a CRC of nothing, and it is still representable.

Switching the cast source to the declared type is correct and measured
byte-identical on this corpus, which means the disagreement does not currently
bite here. Per the rule that a partial fix changing no rendered behaviour does
not stay in the tree, it is not committed on its own; it belongs in the same
change as the refusal that completes it.

### Track C1 was three defects, and none of them was the one named

C1 said definitions classified `Insert` that are narrow writes clearing their
carrier should be `ZeroExtend`. Tracing the five cells found instead:

**The lift already states the clear.** `mov eax, edx` lifts to `Copy` followed
by `IntZExt { dst: RAX, src: EAX }`; Ghidra's x86 specification carries a family
of sub-constructors for exactly this. `materialize_cleared_register_write`
synthesized a second `IntZExt` for the same carrier one op earlier -- twenty-
seven of them in one block of `crc32_bitwise`, none ever read -- and the machine
layer's certificate, which looked at ordinal+1, was reading that invention
rather than the lift. Removing the synthesizer required rewriting the
certificate from an adjacency test into the dataflow question it means: before
anything reads the carrier, does the block define it as a zero-extension of what
this write left in its slice.

**A phi is not a machine write.** `machine_write_disposition` runs on every
graph instruction with an output, phis included, and derives a carrier-relative
projection from geometry alone. For a merge of a sub-register that comes out as
`Insert`, which asserts the merge preserves the carrier's other bits. It neither
does nor could; where the carrier is live across the merge it has a phi of its
own, and that phi is what answers for it. Two of the five cells are phis.

**The phi fold order is a display-name sort.** Each phi kills the slots it
overlaps before seeding its own, so the last phi to mention a register owns
every width of it, and `block.phis` is ordered by display name. That order puts
`EDX` before `RDX` but `R8` before `R8D`, because the wide name is a prefix of
the narrow one only for the extended registers. A 32-bit loop carrier in `r8`
therefore erased its own 64-bit carrier root while identical code in `rdx` did
not, and only across a back edge, where no later program order re-establishes
the carrier. An answer that depends on a name sort cannot be right whichever way
it comes out.

### What the refusals were hiding

Fixing the phi defects takes the corpus from thirty-five to thirty-seven, and
makes `adler32` at O1 render *wrongly*: the machine saves a sum into `r8d`
before clobbering `r9`, and the rendering places both in one C object, so the
saved value is destroyed and the subtraction reads the quotient.

This is the sharpest thing the tracks have produced. The five
`preserved_carrier_read_before_assignment` refusals were not only false, they
were also load-bearing -- they were suppressing a binding-collapse defect
underneath, and removing them exposes it. It follows that clearing a refusal
class is not a safe operation to measure by cell count. Every cell a refusal
fix newly admits has to be checked against the differential oracle before the
fix lands, and a fix that admits a wrong render is not finished, however correct
its own reasoning is.

### Track D: where the seventeen remaining refusals actually come from

With the phi and span defects fixed the corpus is at thirty-seven of
fifty-four and the refusals sort into five classes. Traced:

**Seven cells: no call-site interface at all.** These refuse at the
`CallDefine` arm for want of a call-result source, and the chain runs back
through `process_call_result_flow_block`, which needs a complete call boundary,
to `collect_source_boundary_facts`, which only completes a boundary inside
`if let Some(interface) = machine_context.call_site_interface(call_site.id)`.
For the failing calls that returns `None`, so the boundary is never completed
and every use of a call's result in the function is refused.

The failing calls in `murmur3_32` are three `call sym._rotl32`, and `_rotl32`
is a local function in the same binary. radare2's own signature for it is
`void sym._rotl32 ()` -- no arguments, void return -- for a function that takes
two and returns one. So the answer is not to trust radare2 harder. It is that a
callee we have the code for should have its interface derived from our own
analysis, which is the "sibling-function linking" D2 already names.

**Two facts about this class are worth separating.** The first is that a call
emits one `CallDefine` per register it may have destroyed, and the renderer
treated every one as the call's result: at -O0 `murmur3_32` has nine clobbers
to one result at a single call. The second is that the result register and the
lane the callee's prototype is declared at are different values -- an `int`
returned in `rax` gives a `CallDefine` for `RAX` and one for `EAX` -- and the
boundary certifies the carrier while the program reads the lane. Both are
fixed and measured, and both are currently inert on rendering because the
interface is missing underneath them, so neither is in the tree. They belong in
the same change as whatever supplies the interface.

**Three cells: `preserved_carrier_read_before_assignment`, and these are the
real ones.** Two of the five were phis and are fixed. What is left is genuine
`Insert`: `xor cl, byte [rdi + rax]` in `pearson` at both O1 and O2, and
`movdqa xmm0, xmmword [...]` in `crc32_bitwise` at O2. A byte write into `rcx`
really does preserve the other seven bytes, so `Insert` is the honest
projection and the refusal is asking a fair question: the renderer emits the
preserved bits by reading the object it is assigning, and nothing has assigned
it yet.

**The rest:** two `observation journal`, three `effect obligations refused`,
two `read_before_assignment`. Not yet traced.

### Track C2 rests on a premise that does not hold

C2 said to collapse `stack_address_roots` and `entry_stack_address_roots` into
one map, on the reading that a value with two stack coordinates is the plan's
one defect in the stack model. Tried, and it is not.

The two maps do not answer the same question. `entry_stack_address_roots` says
where a value is relative to the stack pointer the function was entered with,
which is a machine-provable displacement. `stack_address_roots` says where a
value is relative to the base its own frame is addressed from, which for a
function that establishes its own frame is the same fact and for a function
that *receives* a frame pointer is not: a received frame pointer has no
provable relation to the entry stack pointer, and no derivation can supply one.

The measurement is unambiguous. Merging the two by adopting the stronger gates
is byte-identical on all fifty-four corpus cells -- every corpus function
addresses its frame from the stack pointer -- and it breaks
`exact_parameter_home_reuses_one_parameter_binding_identity`, whose fixture
addresses a parameter home from a *received* frame pointer and which then loses
its stack-slot certificate entirely. That is the corpus behaving exactly as the
canary it is: silent about a capability it does not exercise.

So `StackAddressBase` is not a second coordinate system smuggled into one
model. It is the honest statement that two different things can be known about
a stack position, and which one is available depends on the function. The
`base == StackPointer` filters scattered through `semantic.rs` are not leaks;
they are consumers saying they need the stronger fact.

What C2 correctly identified is now done: `rebase_declared_frame_pointer` was
reduced to an identity function by an earlier commit and left standing as a
comment carrier, along with the `declared_stack_bases` argument four call sites
threaded to it. That is deleted.

### The three `xxhash32` cells are protected by a correct refusal

`xxhash32` refuses at O1 and O2 on both architectures with `2 refused, 0
unaccounted, 0 conflicts`. The ledger names them: `codegen/block-not-rendered`
for a `LiveValueProducer` obligation belonging to a phi at `0x10000098d`, a
merge of an eight-byte register.

The name is misleading and the refusal is right. The block *is* rendered --
223 of the function's 267 obligations render and 42 are elided -- so what is
missing is not the block but the attribution of that phi's value to anything
emitted. It would be easy to read that as an accounting gap and discharge it.

It is not. Downgrading the refusal to an elision makes all three cells render
and compile, and all three then **fail the differential oracle**: they return
wrong answers. The obligation is unaccounted because the value really is not
carried, and the ledger is the only thing standing between that defect and a
silent miscompile.

So this class is a rendering defect at a register merge, not an accounting one,
and the fix belongs wherever that phi's value is dropped. Recorded here because
the shape is exactly the failure mode the project has already paid for once: a
detector that looks wrong, a one-line discharge that satisfies it, and a
function that compiles cleanly and computes nothing.

### The merge-materialization predicate, and what it hides

`materialize_certified_loop_carriers_with_control` admits a merge for
materialization when it is a certified loop carrier or when some predecessor
branches, and leaves a merge at a plain join alone on the stated theory that
"the fold can render it as an expression". That theory is false at least once:
`xxhash32`'s `RCX` merge at `0x10000098d` is left as a phi, the fold renders
nothing for it, and readers fall back to a pre-merge value.

Admitting every live merge -- deadness still winning first -- discharges the
obligations that refusal was reporting, and takes the corpus from 37 to 42 of
54. Two of those five, `murmur3_32` at arm64 O1 and O2, are correct.

The other three are `xxhash32` itself, and they are the reason this is not in
the tree. Two fail the raw gate on `unused-but-set-variable`, which is a real
accounting mismatch: the binding has a read occurrence while the statement that
would read it is not emitted. The third compiles and returns wrong answers for
every input of four bytes or more.

So the function was refusing for a correct reason, and behind that refusal is a
second defect in its loop rendering. The materialization change makes it
visible without causing it. The pointer-policy fix it also exposes -- the
certified hint saying "pointer" while the declaration says `uint64_t`, so a load
rendered as `*RDI_0` -- is the same two-answerer defect already fixed for the
assignment policy, and is fixed the same way.

Recorded rather than committed, because the change as it stands admits a cell
that compiles and computes the wrong thing.

### The callee-saved spill slots -- and a wrong cause, corrected

`xxhash32` at x64 O1 and O2 rendered correct answers and failed the strict gate
on `-Wunused-but-set-variable` for the slots `push r14` and `push rbx` write.
The mechanism that should have elided them, `StackFrameRoundTripCertificate`,
declined because the entry values of `rbx` and `r14` had uses outside the round
trip.

This section previously recorded those uses as register-alias-repair artifacts
and named alias repair as the origin. That was wrong, and the way it was wrong
is worth keeping. Two of the four escaping uses per register are bare SSA
merges carrying no `regalias` name at all, so removing alias repair would not
have moved them. The earlier trace stopped at the first plausible name it
recognised instead of walking the whole set.

The actual cause is a contract this file already states elsewhere. `deadphi.rs`
records the decision that a dead merge is *published rather than deleted*,
because the symbolic executor needs it to say what a register holds at a loop
head. What follows from that is an obligation on every rule that chooses among
candidates: ask `DeadPhis`, not the raw use sites. `binding_plan/rules.rs`,
`binding_plan/seal.rs`, `binding_plan/construction.rs` and
`observation_journal.rs` all do. The round-trip certificate did not. It asked
`graph.use_sites`, which answers "is this value named anywhere" rather than
"does the program read it", and every one of the escaping uses terminates in a
merge nothing observes.

Discounting `DeadPhis::unobserved_uses` -- and nothing else -- takes raw from 40
to 42 of 54 and brings all four scores level at 42, with nothing rendered wrong
and no cell lost. The set discounted is the complement of the transitive
closure of live-out, obligation inputs, parameters and call arguments, and
`DeadPhis` returns empty unless the obligation inventory is complete, so a
function whose deadness is not proven still declines.

The general lesson is the one the four conforming call sites already embody: in
a model that deliberately keeps facts it does not intend to render, "named" and
"read" are different questions, and a rule that asks the first while meaning the
second will be wrong exactly where the model is doing its job.

### Direct calls render, and the four defects that reach past them

The corpus went from 42 of 54 correct to 46 generating, with `murmur3_32` and
`xxhash32` at -O0 on both architectures now emitting `sym._rotl32(...)` and its
arguments. The commit message records the seven causes; what belongs here is
the pattern they share, because four of the seven are the same mistake this
file has now recorded three times.

`structural_unused_values` asked `graph.use_sites(value).is_empty()`. A call
clobbers a caller-saved register, the clobber reaches a merge nothing observes,
and the graph records a use where the program has no reader. That is the same
"named" versus "read" confusion as the round-trip certificate above, in a
fourth answerer. The count of answerers that had to be taught the difference is
now five, and the fix is always the same: pass `DeadPhis::unobserved_uses` and
ask what the program reads.

Two more are the same shape one level up. A direct call's target had no
disposition of its own, so a callee's address became an object; and a return
transfer's operands were left unaccounted although its write was already
elided. In both, one part of a construct was recognised as unrendered while
another part of the same construct was left for a statement that would never
exist. `DirectCallTarget` and the return-transfer operand loop close them.

### The preserved-carrier read, and an unsound fix measured and rejected

`pearson` at -O1 and -O2 and `crc32_bitwise` at -O2 refuse with
`preserved_carrier_read_before_assignment`. The trace is exact. In `pearson`,
`xor cl, al` produces a one-byte value at `RCX`'s offset; the next two
instructions zero-extend it to `ECX` and then to `RCX`; and the binding
coalesces all three into one 64-bit object. Because the object is 64 bits and
the write is 8, the geometry gives the write an `Insert` projection, placement
records the preservation as a read of the object, and the read is the object's
first occurrence -- so the function is refused for an uninitialised read.

The graph does not support the preservation. Instruction 64's inputs are two
one-byte values at other locations; no value at `RCX`'s location and no wider
width reaches it. The bits the insert claims to keep are bits the program never
had and never reads: the zero-extension two instructions later defines them.

Making `machine_write_disposition` return `Full` when no input carries a wider
value at the written location clears all three cells and takes the corpus to 43
of 54 with nothing lost and nothing rendered wrong. It was reverted anyway. The
rule is unsound: `write_projection_uses_source_certified_unnamed_vector_lanes`
writes a four-byte lane at bit offset 32 of a 128-bit carrier from two
temporaries, and the rule calls that `Full` -- an assertion that a write at a
non-zero offset fills the carrier, which is simply false. Narrowing it to
offset zero does not rescue it either: `Full` still claims the upper bits are
defined by this write, and only `exact_zero_extend_write` may claim that.

What the case actually needs is a distinction the projection vocabulary does
not carry. `Full` means "this write defines the carrier", `Insert` means "this
write preserves the rest of it", and the truth here is neither: the write
defines its lane and the rest of the carrier is dead. Two ways out are open,
and the second looks better. Either the vocabulary gains that third case, and
the renderer emits a plain narrow assignment for it -- which also requires the
object to be narrow, or the upper bits are undefined in the C as well; or the
coalescing declines in the first place, on the ground that a value and its own
zero-extension are different objects rather than one object at two widths.
`rules.rs` already owns that decision and already declines two other unsound
coalescings, which is where the next attempt should start.

Not attempted: three cells are blocked on vector width rather than on the
binding spine. `adler32` at x64 -O2 refuses with a 128-bit constant, and
`crc32_bitwise` and `xxhash32` at arm64 -O2 refuse for a missing literal
projection on NEON code. Those need vector types, not a spine fix.

### What the call cells stop on now, and two traced dead ends

Four cells generate and fail to compile rather than failing to render:
`murmur3_32` and `xxhash32` at -O0 on both architectures. On arm64 the errors
are frame slots the function writes and never reads, and the entry values of
`x29`/`x30` read before assignment; on x64 they are sign conversions on
stack-slot stores. Two more, `murmur3_32` at -O1 and -O2, now reach an
unaccounted use of a `BranchInd` target: the tail switch is a jump table, the
structurer never builds a `Region::Switch` for it, and nothing else accounts
for the target operand. No corpus function has ever rendered a jump table, so
that path is untested rather than broken in a known way.

Three of the eight remaining cells are not the binding spine at all. Two are
genuine NEON: `crc32_bitwise` and `xxhash32` at arm64 -O2 compute their result
through vector lanes, and `SSAOp::CallOther` is an unconditional refusal in the
renderer. The third, `adler32` at x64 -O2, is not a vector problem despite
looking like one: the function contains no SSE at all, and its 128-bit constant
is how Ghidra lifts `imul r10, rcx, 0x2001f` -- both operands sign-extended to
sixteen bytes, multiplied, and sliced. `bit_vector` refuses any constant whose
*varnode* is wider than eight bytes, although a p-code constant carries its
value in a `u64` and so provably fits. The register form of the same
instruction already renders, which is why `adler32` at -O1 passes and -O2 does
not. `fletcher32` at x64 -O2 fails identically. That guard is two functions in
one file and everything downstream already accepts 128 bits.

Two attempts were traced to their end and reverted.

The first was the preserved-carrier read, from the other side. Declining to
coalesce a value with its own widening does clear `pearson` and
`crc32_bitwise`, but it cannot tell that shape from the legitimate one:
`xxhash32` at -O1 coalesces a 32-bit value with the 64-bit one it becomes, and
declining there splits a loop carrier and duplicates its edge. Both are
narrow-defined-then-widened at one location, so no rule over that shape alone
separates them. Pairing the decline with a placement rule that only counts the
carrier read when a member is wider than the write then rendered
`CL_2 = (CL_2 & ~mask) | ...` on a `uint64_t` object, and clang caught the
uninitialised read that placement had stopped catching. That is worth stating
plainly: the placement refusal was standing in front of the defect, and
silencing it moved the same error to the compiler. What sets the object's width
is `binding_width`, which takes the maximum of member width, use-slice carrier
and *write carrier* -- so a single-member one-byte binding is declared 64 bits
by the register geometry alone. Any future attempt has to answer that first.

The second was the dead frame slot. Placement decides `DeadStore` for those
slots and its trial removal discards nothing, because `discard_observed_statement`
matches only a marker on the statement and a stack write is marked on the
expression the assignment writes to. Teaching it to recognise a statement whose
assignment target carries the mark makes the removal work -- and the removal
then loses the `ObservableMemoryWrite` obligation each store owns, so the effect
ledger refuses the function. Guarding the removal on that obligation restores
the four cells and costs `adler32` at x64 -O0, where the same pass legitimately
removes a statement that owns one. So the guard is not the answer either. The
missing piece is upstream of both: a certificate that a slot in this function's
own frame, written and never read, is not observable from outside, which is what
would let the obligation elide and the store go. `CalleeStackAllocationCertificate`
already proves the allocation is this function's; `collect_stack_frame_round_trip_certificates`
declines these objects only because `reads.is_empty()`.

### The jump table never reaches the CFG

`murmur3_32` at -O1 and -O2 refuse with an unaccounted use of a `BranchInd`
target, and the reason is upstream of the renderer. radare2 resolves the table
-- `jmp r8 ; switch table (4 cases)` at `0x10000087a` -- but no block in the
function we build has three or more successors, so `detect_switch` is never
reached, no `Region::Switch` is formed, and the only thing that would render the
dispatch operand (`get_switch_expression`, through `planned_input_expr_at`) is
never called. The four case blocks are reachable in the binary and unreachable
in our control-flow graph.

So the fix is not in the structurer or in the observation journal: the resolved
table's edges have to reach the SSA function's successors in the first place.
The facts are already imported -- `control_facts().switch_for_block` answers for
this block -- and what is missing is the edge set that would let the region
analyser see a multi-way dispatch. Until then a jump table cannot be rendered on
any function, which is why no corpus cell has ever exercised that path.

### What the four call cells now need, which is not a renderer change

`murmur3_32` and `xxhash32` at -O0 render a call and fail to compile. Two of the
errors are ours and recorded above. The third thing is not: the corpus harness
builds one function into a whole program, and it has no way to supply a
definition for the function that one calls. `verify_rendering` knows only
`dec_<name>`, so `sym__rotl32` is an undefined symbol at link time no matter
what the renderer emits. Making these cells pass needs the harness to render and
include the callee as well -- the natural next corpus capability now that calls
render at all, and worth doing before more renderer work is aimed at these four.

### The lane projection, and where it deliberately stops

`MachineWriteProjection::Lane` closes the gap this file recorded: `Full` claims
a write defines its whole register, `Insert` claims it preserves the rest, and a
byte computed from two bytes does neither. The admission condition is that no
operand of the instruction sits at the carrier -- preserving bits requires
having them, and in SSA an instruction has a value only by taking it as an
input. That cleared `pearson` and `crc32_bitwise` at -O2, and unlike the `Full`
rule rejected earlier it keeps `bit_offset`, so it never asserts the register
was filled.

It is restricted to a lane at the carrier's own offset, and that restriction is
the interesting part. `mov ah, bl` writes bits 8..16 of `RAX` from `BL` and
takes no `RAX` operand, so the input-side condition alone would call it a lane;
but a later read of `AL` or `RAX` is composed from the value that write
produces, so the preservation is real. Requiring offset zero keeps every
genuine-lift high-slice expectation intact.

The cost is the one cell that needs the general answer. `crc32_bitwise` at x64
-O2 now stops on `XMM2_Db`, a 32-bit lane at bit offset 32 of a 512-bit `ZMM2`,
written by one of the four per-lane adds a `paddd` decomposes into. Nothing
reads `ZMM2` outside its lanes -- each sibling write reads its own lane -- so
the preservation is as fictional there as it was for the byte case, and the
offset restriction is what keeps it. Telling that apart from `mov ah, bl` needs
the use-side question rather than the operand-side one: does anything read a bit
of this carrier outside this lane. That is the same "ask what the program
reads" move this file already credits five times, and it is what the next
attempt should implement -- as a condition on `Lane`, not as a placement gate,
because the renderer must emit a plain assignment or the uninitialised read
simply moves to the compiler.

### The one thing between the four call cells and compiling

`murmur3_32` and `xxhash32` at -O0 render a call on both architectures and now
fail the strict compile on exactly one class: frame slots the function writes
and never reads, declared and assigned and never used. Everything else that
stood there is gone -- the undeclared callee, the prototype that contradicted
the callee's own rendering, and the machine's return-address push through an
uninitialised stack pointer.

The mechanism is understood end to end. Placement decides `DeadStore` for those
slots and its trial removal discards nothing, because
`discard_observed_statement` matches only a marker on the statement while a
stack write is marked on the expression the assignment writes to. Teaching it to
recognise a statement whose assignment target carries the mark makes the removal
work, and the removal then loses each store's `ObservableMemoryWrite`, so the
effect ledger refuses the function. Guarding the removal on that obligation is
not the answer either: it restores the cells and costs `adler32` at x64 -O0,
where the same pass legitimately removes a statement owning one.

What closes it is a certificate that a slot in this function's own frame,
written and never read, is not observable from outside -- observable is the
word the obligation uses, and it means observable by someone else.
`CalleeStackAllocationCertificate` is exactly that proof, and the reason this
does not simply work is worth recording: for `murmur3_32` on arm64 all
eighteen stack slots come back with `callee_allocation: None`. The allocation
proof is not issued for these functions at all, and they are the functions that
call. Whatever excludes them in `collect_callee_stack_allocation_certificates`
is the thing to fix; the three consumers below it -- the elision reason, the
effect-ledger arm keyed on the access's block and op index, and the discarder --
were written against that certificate and measured inert without it, so they
were not kept.

### Why a calling function has no frame-slot certificate, traced to the end

The four call cells fail the strict compile on frame slots written and never
read, and what would let those stores go is a certificate that the slot lies in
storage this function owns. `collect_callee_stack_allocation_certificates`
issues one for the corpus's leaf functions and none at all for the two that
call. The chain is now complete, and every link was measured rather than
inferred.

`certificates().stack_slots` for `murmur3_32` on arm64 holds eighteen slots and
not one has a `callee_allocation`. The collector rejects them before it reaches
its call-related gate: `objects.entry_stack_roots` has no entry for any of
them, so the slot's address is never tied back to the entry stack pointer.

That set is built in `crates/r2ssa/src/function.rs` around line 2939, and it is
withheld deliberately. `entry_stack_roots_are_stable` requires, for every call
in the function, that `call_carriers_are_restored` -- the source interface must
say the stack pointer, and the frame pointer if there is one, survive a call.
Without that a call could move the stack under the slot and no entry-relative
offset means anything.

The interface never says it, because there is no interface. radare2 does set
`stack_pointer_preserved_across_calls` and its frame-pointer twin early in
`function_interface_snapshot_collect` (libr/anal/function.c around 3939), with a
comment saying it does so precisely "so signatureless functions do not lose
entry-relative facts". Then at function.c:3949 it returns early for any function
whose signature is not *address*-linked, before `interface->complete` is
assigned at :4103 -- and `complete` is what sets
`R_ANAL_FUNCTION_SNAPSHOT_CAP_EXACT_FUNCTION_INTERFACE` at :6129. Our capture
(`crates/r2source/src/radare_abi138.rs` around 1855) only reads the interface
when that capability is present, so the flags radare2 published for exactly this
purpose are discarded, and every non-DWARF binary loses its whole snapshot
interface.

Two ways to close it, and they are not equivalent. Upstream, `complete` conflates
a physical interface -- stack pointer, return address, calling convention,
preservation -- with a signature, and a function with no linked signature still
has the first; separating them is a radare2 correctness fix and belongs in its
own PR. On our side, the preservation flags are carried by the interface view
whether or not it is exact, and reading them without demanding an exact
interface would be enough on its own, though it means `SourceFunctionInterface`
growing a partial form -- which is the same distinction `params_known` already
draws for the function being rendered.

### The jump table: what is actually wrong, and a fix that was wrong

The earlier note here said the resolved table's edges never reach the CFG. That
was wrong and is corrected. The edges are there, the terminator is a
`BlockTerminator::Switch` on the right block, and the region analyser does build
a `Region::Switch` -- through the iterative composer at `region.rs:1389`, not
through `detect_switch`, which is only reachable for a function with no loops
and so is dead on this route.

The defect is in `get_switch_expression` (`structure.rs`), which declines unless
the `BranchInd`'s target value *is* the switch selector. For a real jump table
it never is: `switch (len & 3)` computes the index, loads an address out of a
table, and dispatches through that address, so the operand is the loaded target
and the selector is several instructions upstream. The only shape satisfying the
equality is the unit fixture's undefined target, which is why the tests pass and
no corpus function has ever rendered a switch. The cutover that introduced the
gate also orphaned the producer that would answer it:
`switch_selector_expr_by_block` in `analysis/prepared_semantic.rs` is still
computed and has had no reader since.

Removing the gate, printing the selector, and accounting the dispatch operand
and its `ControlTransfer` the way a direct branch's are -- both certified by the
switch certificate -- takes generation from 49 to 51 and raw from 45 to 47, and
it is wrong. The differential catches it: `murmur3_32` at -O1 and -O2 compile
and compute the wrong answer, the first compile-but-wrong cells this corpus has
produced in this work. The reason is visible in the output. The cases render as
`/* case 0: goto loc_1000008a9; */` -- comments. The structured form never
emitted the switch body, so the transfer genuinely was unrendered and the
obligation refusal was standing in front of that, exactly as this file has
recorded five times before.

So the order is fixed: `structure_switch_region` has to emit the cases as
control flow first. Only once the body is there does accounting the dispatch as
control describe what the rendering does, and until then the two elisions must
not be added -- they convert a refusal into a wrong answer.

### The switch, four gates further, and the one that is a modelling gap

Four separate defects sat between a resolved jump table and a structured
switch. Each was traced, fixed and measured, and the chain is saved as
`switch-chain.patch` rather than kept, because together they still render
nothing: the fifth gate holds.

The identity gate in `get_switch_expression` required the `BranchInd`'s target
to *be* the selector, which is true only of the unit fixture. The dispatch was
looked for as the block's last operation, and it is not: materializing a
merge's incoming edges appends copies after the terminator, so the search found
a `Copy` and declined. The selector's expression had no reader --
`switch_selector_expr_by_block` has been computed and unread since the
exact-lowering cutover removed its only consumer. And the certified case list
was compared literally against the rendered one, so `murmur3_32`'s `case 0`,
whose target is the merge block, counted as missing; it is an empty case, and
omitting it is exactly what C means, because with no arm for that value the
switch falls past itself to the merge.

With those four the switch structures. What stops it now is not a gate to
relax. `rendered_branch_occurrences_cover_source` compares the rendered guard
vector against the source control domain's, and for case block `0x100000885`
the rendered side is `[SwitchArm { case_values: [2] }]` while the source side is
**empty**. An empty domain says the block executes on every path, which is false
for a case body, and no comparison can be made to hold between a guard and
nothing. `control_domains` does not express switch-arm membership for the blocks
a dispatch reaches, and until it does, accepting the mismatch would be
suppressing the one check that noticed.

That is the whole remaining distance on this track, and it is one thing:
give the control-domain model a switch-arm guard for each case block, including
the fall-through case where a block is reached both by its own arm and from the
arm above it. The four fixes above are re-applied with it.

Read once more, the fifth gate is sharper than "no switch-arm membership".
`control_guard_for_edge` does produce a `ControlGuard::SwitchArm` for a switch
edge, so the guard exists. What empties the domain is that a domain is the
guards common to every path into the block, and `0x100000885` is reached both by
its own arm and by falling through from the arm above it. The intersection of
`{arm 2}` and `{arm 3}` is empty, which is a true statement about common guards
and a useless one about when the block runs.

`SwitchArm` already carries `case_values` as a vector, so the union is
expressible: the block runs when the selector is one of `[2, 3]`. Making the
domain merge same-switch arms rather than drop them is the change, and it has to
be made in the intersection itself rather than in the comparison, because the
comparison is what catches a genuinely unrendered block.

The union was implemented and it is not sufficient on its own, which sharpens
the remaining work once more. With same-switch arms merged in the meet, the
source domain for `0x100000885` becomes `SwitchArm { case_values: [2, 3] }` --
correct, and it says the block runs when the selector is 2 or 3. The rendered
occurrence still says `[2]`, because on the renderer's side a guard is
accumulated per CFG edge and the fall-through from `case 3` is not an edge it
walks: in the emitted C that path is textual adjacency, the absence of a
`break`. So the third side of the same question is the renderer's occurrence
accumulation, which has to union the arms of the cases that fall into a body --
knowledge `structure_switch_region` already computes when it decides which
`break`s to omit.

`switch-chain.patch` now carries all five fixes and is verified against this
commit. What remains is that one accumulation.

### The switch chain, eight fixes in, and the gate that is left

Three more defects fell after the five above, and `switch-chain.patch` now
carries all eight, verified against this commit.

Merging same-switch arms in the domain meet is right and not sufficient on its
own: it hands the block the switch converges on an arm covering every case,
which says the block runs whatever the selector is -- a guard that constrains
nothing, and the rendering correctly has none. A merged arm that covers every
case, and the default where there is one, is dropped.

The renderer needed the same union from the other side. A case body reached by
its own arm and by falling through from the one above runs for both values, and
the guard the renderer pushes was its own value alone. `structure_switch_region`
already computes which regions fall through when it decides where to omit
`break`, so the reaching set is computed there and the pushed `SwitchArm`
widened to it, transitively -- `case 3` into `case 2` into `case 1` means case
1's body runs for all three.

With those the structurer is satisfied: the switch structures, the domains
cover, and `murmur3_32` at -O1 reaches declaration placement. What stops it
there is the heading. The selector expression taken from the orphaned producer
is assembled outside the observation machinery and carries no marker, so
placement sees a symbol read nothing authorizes -- `active=[]`. Building the
heading as the selector's own symbol through
`observe_certified_value_read_expr`, which is what records a read of a value at
an instruction, moves the unauthorized read to a second binding rather than
removing it, so the switch statement's own construct is not yet an observation
scope its heading falls inside.

That is the next thing, and it is the last one this track has surfaced: the
`switch (...)` heading has to be observed as part of the switch construct, the
way a conditional's predicate is. Everything before it is done and measured
safe -- eight fixes, no cell lost, no wrong answer -- and waits in the patch.

The heading, traced to its end. A conditional's predicate is observed as
`planned_input_expr_at(block, branch_idx, 1)` -- the condition is an *operand*
of the `CBranch`, so there is an input to observe. A dispatch has no such
operand: `BranchInd`'s only input is the computed target, which is why the
identity gate existed at all. The selector is several instructions upstream and
is not an operand of anything the switch renders.

`observe_certified_value_read_expr` looked like the answer and is not. It
records a read against the same boundary record the placement audit uses, and
that record is about call results and returns; a selector read at a dispatch is
not one, so the observer takes its silent fallback and returns the expression
unwrapped. Placement then sees a symbol read with `active=[]` -- no target at
all -- which is exactly what it is for: an unauthorized read of a program
variable.

So the last step on this track is a new observation target: the value a switch
dispatches on, read at the dispatch. It has to be minted in the journal
alongside `CertifiedValueRead`, projected in `placement_target_for` the way that
one is, and accepted by `target_authorizes_binding` for a read. That is a change
to the proof machinery's vocabulary rather than to a rule inside it, which is
why it is written down here rather than attempted at the end of a long session:
the whole point of that vocabulary is that each kind means one thing, and adding
one carelessly is how two tables come to answer for the same read.

### The frame slots, and why the certificate finally issues

The chain that withheld `CalleeStackAllocationCertificate` from every calling
function is now fully understood and the fix is written, in
`frame-slot-chain.patch`, verified against this commit. It is not kept, because
no arrangement of its last two pieces beats what is already here.

What was wrong is worth stating. `entry_stack_roots_are_stable` asks whether a
call leaves the frame carriers alone, and asked the *function interface*.
radare2 computes that from the calling convention and records it even for a
function whose signature it never linked -- its own comment says so -- but the
interface block is only written when `CAP_EXACT_FUNCTION_INTERFACE` is set,
which radare2 withholds for exactly those functions. The interface still
arrives, reconstructed with both flags defaulted to false, so the answerer that
did not know was the one being asked. Carrying the fact beside the machine
roles, where the carriers themselves already travel for the same reason, and
preferring it over the interface's copy, makes the certificate issue: sixteen
objects in `murmur3_32` on arm64 where there were none. That part is right and
the wire format carries it at version 4.

With the certificate, `certified_dead_frame_slot_accesses` answers the
`ObservableMemoryWrite` obligation for a slot written and never read, and
teaching `discard_observed_statement` to recognise a write marked on its
assignment target lets those stores actually go. `stack_m*` disappears from
`murmur3_32`.

What is unresolved is the last store of the arm64 prologue's `stp x29, x30`.
Its object has one write and reads, so it is not a dead slot; it is a frame
round trip, and `collect_stack_frame_round_trip_certificates` declines it
because the saved register overlaps the return-address storage. Removing that
exclusion does not help on its own. So the discarder removes a statement whose
obligation nothing answers, and the two arm64 cells stop generating. Guarding
removal on "owns an effect nothing answers" restores them and costs `adler32`
at x64 -O0, where the same pass removes a statement that owns an
`ObservableMemoryWrite` and is accounted through `placement_elided_observations`
instead -- so the guard is asking the wrong question too.

The right question is the one that path already answers: will this removal be
accounted, rather than does this statement own an effect. That is the next step,
and it is a single predicate once the round-trip exclusion for the return
address is settled, because those two are what make the arm64 store special.

## Track status, checked against the tracks rather than the cell count

**A -- remove the many answerers: done.** `UseInfo` is ten fields, from
thirty-one. Every string-keyed duplicate named in A2 is gone --
`value_ids_by_name`, `formatted_defs`, `stable_memory_values_by_value` and the
`unkeyed_writes` drift counter it measured have no references left. The alias
ladder A4 names is gone too; the `param_aliases` that remain in `r2types` are a
different thing, the type database's own parameter aliases.

**B -- make inference unrepresentable: done.** B1 held once `RecordedType`
became a newtype only the fact layer can construct: the compiler enumerates
every cast site. B2 is closed now. The two sites that still reached the policy
with nothing -- a call's derived result lane, and a binary operation whose
operands are recorded at different types -- now state their type, the first from
the carrier object's declaration and the second from C's usual arithmetic
conversions, which is a rule rather than a guess. Every cell that renders
reaches the policy with a recorded source on all six configurations. The twelve
decisions this paragraph recorded as remaining were in `crc32_bitwise` at x64
-O2, on a bit-vector operand with no integer conversion rule, in a cell that did
not render at the time. That cell renders now, and whether those decisions
survived the object-width change has not been re-measured.

**C -- finish what was started: done, with C2 superseded.** C1's five
`preserved_carrier_read_before_assignment` cells are resolved -- by following the
two-hop widening chain and by the `Lane` projection, both above. C3's rules live
in `binding_plan/rules.rs` and both derivations call them. C2's deletion half is
done: `rebase_declared_frame_pointer` no longer exists. Its collapse half should
not be done. The two root maps are no longer one fact keyed twice:
`stack_address_roots` holds every declared stack base, and
`entry_stack_address_roots` holds the stability-gated stack-pointer-relative
subset that the entry-root machinery and the frame-slot certificate depend on.
Merging them would delete that gate.

**D -- the corpus to parity: done.** Fifty-four of fifty-four, with generation,
the strict gate, the diagnostic gate and the differential oracle all reading
fifty-four. What this paragraph used to say -- 51 of 54, three cells refusing,
two of them NEON and "a feature rather than a defect" -- was wrong about the
last part: the NEON cells needed two user operations given their semantics and
one offset stopped being applied twice, all of which are defects. The closing
entry at the end of this document records what actually closed it.

One caveat belongs with the number, not against it: the verifier rewrites the C
it checks, cutting the image's bytes into a blob and rewriting absolute addresses
into it. So the score does not say those cells emit self-contained, independently
compilable C, and the corpus remains a canary rather than a specification.

### Track D closed to the vectorised cells

Both defects the previous note described are fixed, and the corpus stands at 51
of 54 with all four scores equal -- generation, strict, diagnostic and
differential -- and no strict failure anywhere. What the note recorded as three
separate causes turned out to be two, and the deeper one was neither of the
places the traces had pointed at.

The saved link register was a symptom. radare2 reports the machine role carriers
as offsets into its own register arena, and every consumer here reads a
canonical register offset as an offset in the Sleigh architecture's register
space. The two numberings coincide for the stack pointer on the corpus machines
and for nothing else, so `sp` worked and the link register was reported at
offset zero -- a register the architecture does not have there. Every comparison
of a carrier against a value's storage failed silently, which is why removing
the return-address exclusion from the frame collector had been measured inert:
that exclusion had never fired. The name now travels beside the storage and the
lift resolves it against the architecture that was actually loaded. The plugin's
own register profile also had to declare `=LR`, without which radare2's lookup
walks LR, RA, PC and settles on the program counter.

The two remaining strict failures were then one defect, on both architectures at
once: `sub sp, sp, #0x70` lifts with the carry and sign computations beside it,
nothing reads those flags, and the stack-geometry certificate counted their
operands as readers of the stack pointer. The rule it already applied to frame
and return-control uses -- a use inside a definition nothing observes is not a
read -- was simply missing for the merge analysis's answer.

The three cells that remain do not render at all, and all three are vectorised:
`crc32_bitwise` and `xxhash32` at arm64 -O2 are NEON (`dup`, `cmeq`, `bic`,
`ext`, `fmov`), and `crc32_bitwise` at x64 -O2 is SSE. The x86 one refuses later
than the others -- its body lowers and the refusal is in declaration placement --
but the cause is the same: the lift decomposes a 128-bit vector into named dword
lanes, something reads the vector as a whole, so each lane write is a genuine
insert into an object no statement has assembled. Admitting those writes as
lanes was tried, gated on nothing in the function composing a wider value from
the carrier, and measured to change nothing, because the wider read is really
there. These three need vector values in the rendered C, which is a feature and
not a defect; nothing in the current model is wrong about them.

### Superseded: Track D's last three cells, traced to their causes

Three cells render, compute the right answer, and miss the strict gate. Both
were traced to a named predicate; neither fix landed, and the notes below say
why each attempt failed so the next one starts further on.

**`stack_m8` on arm64 -- the saved link register.** The slot at entry-SP minus
eight is the `x30` half of the prologue's `stp x29, x30`. Its reload is already
elided, by the return-control certificate rather than by the frame round trip,
which is why the rendering shows a save and no matching load: a variable set and
never used, assigned from an `X30_0` nothing initialised. The `x29` half passes
the round-trip collector and is elided; `x30` fails it three times over -- the
saved register overlaps the return-address storage
(`collect_stack_frame_round_trip_certificates`, the `roles.return_address_storage()`
arm), `exact_copy_chain_to_storage` requires the restored value to have no use
sites and the restored `x30` is the return's operand, and the closure check
rejects that same use.

Removing only the first of those changes nothing, which is measured. The right
owner is the certificate that already holds the reload: absorb the slot's single
write and the copy chain from the entry return address into
`collect_machine_return_control_certificates`, so one collector owns the pair
and the double-claim refusal in the observation journal cannot fire. Attempting
that showed the walk never reaches its `Load` arm for these functions -- the
certificate that matters ends with five instructions and is then rejected for one
escaping value -- so the chain terminates before the load, and finding where is
the next step. The companion edit is already known: the two places that elide a
stack object's declaration accept only objects in `stack_frame_round_trips`, and
must also accept one a return-control certificate claims.

**`RSP_0` on x64 -- one frame-address computation that escapes.** The return
address pushes are all elided; what renders is `push rbp` and the stack-pointer
decrement of eight calls, and they render only because `RBP_1` acquires exactly
one reader: `tmp_4700_68 = RBP_1 + -0x20`, the address operand of a load that
already renders as its named slot. It is the only one of thirty-six such
computations in the function that escapes `StackGeometryCertificate`; its
byte-identical twin four instructions later is elided. Its single use is that
load's address, and it has no reader in the C at all -- removing that one
statement leaves `RBP_1` unread, which takes the whole `RSP` chain onto the
unobserved path `murmur3_32` already follows.

The arm64 sibling shows one predicate that can do this: `add x29, sp, #0x60`
carries its immediate through a copy, and the certificate's `is_constant`
required a literal varnode. Teaching it to follow a copy chain to a constant is
measured and changes nothing, so that is not the x64 case, and the exclusion is
somewhere in the closure -- either the load's use missing from
`stack_address_uses`, or `resolve_entry_stack_root` returning nothing for that
temp. That is one instrumented run away.

### What the three vectorised cells actually need

Both refusals were traced to their first point, and neither is where the printed
message pointed.

**The two arm64 -O2 cells refuse on `SSAOp::CallOther`.** The machine
projection's operation match has no arm for it, so it falls to
`MachineBuildError::UnsupportedOperation`, which `is_local_projection_failure`
classifies as local. The projection then completes with those instructions
unprojected, their constant operands are never interned as machine expressions,
and the binding plan gives those constants `MissingLiteralProjection`. Whole-graph
preflight surfaces the lowest-numbered refused value, and that is relabelled
`missing_machine_projection_authorization` -- an authority that did not fail, and
a value that is only the first casualty. The instructions are
`ext v3.16b, v2.16b, v2.16b, 8` in `crc32_bitwise` and two `ushl v.4s` in
`xxhash32`. The control case settles it: `crc32_init` carries the identical NEON
lift with no `CallOther`, clears the projection stage entirely, and fails much
later. So 128-bit registers, register geometry and sixteen-byte loads all work
already; what is missing is a machine semantics for those two Sleigh userops --
a lane-wise byte extract and a lane-wise variable shift -- and a C spelling for
the result, since the type layer tops out at `__uint128_t` with no lane
structure.

**The x64 -O2 cell is two defects deep.** Its carrier resolves to the 512-bit
ZMM register while every value in the function lives at 128-bit XMM width or
32-bit lane width, and bits 128 to 511 are never written and never read. A lane
write at a non-zero offset is therefore classified `Insert`, which widens the
binding to 512 bits and lowers to a field insert reading the binding on its own
right-hand side -- a read of an object no statement has assigned. One `pshufd`
yields four objects of two different widths, because the lane at offset zero
takes the `Lane` branch and its three siblings do not. Admitting `Lane` at any
offset was measured: it moves the refusal past placement and costs no cell, but
does not render, because the next thing in the way is the sixteen-byte
`movdqa` load of a constant table. Its address is an inlined literal with no
rendered occurrence, and no corpus function has ever rendered a load from a
fixed data address, so the rendered C would also have to carry the table's bytes
for the differential oracle to mean anything.

Both remaining pieces are features with their own gates, not defects in the
current model, and each should be planned as such rather than attempted as a
patch: userop semantics with lane-wise rendering, and constant-data emission.


### The arm64 -O2 NEON cell, traced to a wrongly exempted interference

`NEON_ext` expanded at the lift into two shifts and an or makes `crc32_bitwise`
at arm64 -O2 render, and the expansion is right: a numeric model following the
instructions and one following the rendered C agree on the whole vector block --
`dup`, `and`, `cmeq`, `bic`, `ext`, `eor` and `fmov` all reproduce the reference
fold. What the cell returns is `ffffffff` for every non-empty input, and the
cause is none of that.

The lift routes both `w10` and `w11` through one p-code temporary. In SSA that is
correct and unambiguous -- `tmp:20380` versions two through eight, each defined
exactly once -- and `eor w10, w10, w11` reads versions six and seven at the same
instruction. The binding plan then put four of those versions in one C object, so
that statement became the exclusive-or of a value with itself, which is zero for
every input on every iteration.

The rule that should decline this is `values_read_together`, and it declines only
pairs at *different* machine locations. The exemption was written on the reading
that a carrier coalescing two runs of one register is ordinary. Two runs are
ordinary; two runs a single instruction reads at once are not, whatever they are
stored in, because both hold their content at that instruction.

Removing the exemption fixes this cell and **costs eight others**, which fail
their strict compile rather than rendering anything wrong. Declining a coalescing
gives the values their own objects, and the narrower types those get trip
`-Wconversion` in code that previously shared one wide object. So the
interference rule is right and the typing of separated objects is the weakness
behind it; the two have to be fixed together, and the second is its own piece of
work rather than an adjustment to the first.

Two further defects in the same rendering, both real and neither answerable for
the wrong value: the `dup` byte projection applies its lane offset twice around a
truncation, so twelve of sixteen bytes render as zero -- the same double-offset
shape already fixed for the x86 128-bit lanes, here at eight-bit lanes of a
thirty-two-bit value, which the fix's condition does not reach; and the
sixteen-bit `Piece` composition renders as `(uint16_t)a << 8 | (uint16_t)b`,
whose promotion to `int` trips `-Wimplicit-int-conversion` at twenty-eight sites.
Both are value-preserving here, which is why the cell's wrong answer survives
fixing either.


### The last cell, and the correctness hole behind it

`NEON_ushl` expanded per element makes `xxhash32` at arm64 -O2 render, and all
fifty-four cells then generate and compile under the strict flags. The digest is
wrong for every input of sixteen bytes or more -- exactly where the function
enters its vectorised stripe loop -- and the expansion is not the reason. It was
checked op for op against the architecture over three million random per-element
vectors and all two hundred and fifty-six shift bytes, with no disagreement, and
it yields the correct digest when executed.

What is wrong is upstream, and it is a correctness hole rather than a missing
capability. `fmov w11, s0` publishes the vector merge into a general register.
The specification writes that as two halves: the low four bytes of `x11`, and
`zext_rs`, which is `reg[32,32] = 0`, zeroing the upper four. Both writes are in
the SSA -- `w11` version one, and `reg:405c` version one set to zero -- and
**neither composes into a definition of `x11`**. Every later read of `x11`
therefore reaches back past them to the prologue's `x11` version eight, a dead
constant holding `PRIME1` that exists only to feed a `dup`. The rendered function
computes `PRIME1 + len` where the machine computes the accumulator merge.
Substituting `PRIME1` for the merge reproduces all four wrong digests bit-exact.

Two things make this worse than a wrong answer in one cell. The whole vector
chain -- twenty instructions -- is then genuinely unreachable from any
observation, so the elision machinery removes it and is right to; the falsehood
is one step earlier. And the obligation ledger recorded twenty-five elisions and
**zero refusals**, so a use-visible miscompile passed as a clean proof. Every
`ElisionReason` is documented as a form of proven-dead, and here the deadness was
a consequence of the missing definition rather than a fact about the program.

The fix belongs where the halves are written: a pair of adjacent writes that
together cover a register must define that register. `machine.rs` already has
exactly this reasoning for write *projections*, in
`exact_adjacent_cleared_carrier_write`, which follows a narrow write into the
extension that clears the rest of its carrier. The same fact has to reach the SSA
definition, not only the projection, or a full-width read cannot see it.

**Landed.** A merge source is now composed from the parts that define it, so the
deadness proof is no longer false. See the closing entry at the end of this
track.


### What is left of the last cell

The false deadness proof is fixed: a merge source is now composed from the parts
that define it, so `fmov w11, s0` reaches the merge and `xxhash32` at arm64 -O2
no longer computes `PRIME1 + len`. With `NEON_ushl` expanded, all fifty-four
cells generate, and what remains is an honest compile error rather than a wrong
answer.

The error is a narrow value assigned to a carrier-wide object:
`S0_2 = (uint32_t)...` where `S0_2` is declared `struct r2sleigh_bits_256`. Four
objects in that function are declared at 256 bits; `crc32_bitwise` on the same
architecture, which passes, declares none. The difference is not the vector code
-- it is that `xxhash32`'s vector registers cross a loop back edge, so they are
merged, and a merge is built at the register family's *maximal* slot. On AArch64
that slot is the 32-byte SVE `z0`, and the phi-source projections are made at its
width, which drags the 32-bit lane values into 256-bit objects even though
nothing in the program ever holds or reads more than 128 bits.

Traced further, the shape is sharper than that. `S0_2` is read *both* ways in
the same function: `r2sleigh_bits_extract_256_32(S0_2, 0U)` inside the loop, and
plainly as `(uint32_t)S0_2` in the setup before it. Those are two different SSA
values sharing one binding, and self-containment is decided per value while the
object is shared per binding. So one member is narrow and another
carrier-relative, the binding takes the wider, and the narrow member's write
becomes a narrow value assigned to a wide object.

The requirement is therefore uniformity: every value sharing an object must
agree about whether it is read as itself. Imposing that in the projection, by
requiring every value overlapping a value's storage to agree, is too strong and
**costs all three vector cells** -- on x86 each lane overlaps the whole register,
so one carrier-relative wide value poisons every lane in it. Overlap is not the
grouping that matters; the storage *span* is. Requiring agreement across a span
was measured too, and **costs `crc32_bitwise` at arm64 -O2**, a cell that passes:
withdrawing a member makes it carrier-relative, and its binding is then wider
than the value its write produces -- the very error being chased.

That is the useful result. All four attempts adjust *which* values are read as
themselves, while the error is about something else. A lane write whose binding
is wider than the value it produces renders as a bare assignment, and there is no
assignment from a narrow value to a wide object. Whichever way the read side is
decided, that write has to render as a field insert -- the prelude already
provides `r2sleigh_bits_insert_*` -- and the first insert into an object no
statement has assigned is exactly the placement refusal this began from.

A fifth attempt went at the carrier itself, on the reading that the width comes
from a specification nesting -- x86 vector registers inside a 512-bit `ZMM`,
AArch64 ones inside a 32-byte SVE `Z` -- that these programs never address.
Narrowing the carrier to the narrowest declared register covering what the
function actually touches is **unsound**: four cells stop compiling and two
compute the wrong answer. The carrier is not merely a width; the projection's
arithmetic is stated against it, and moving it moves what every slice means.

### Option B measured: sound, and blocked by one other thing

The second of the two decisions below was then tried whole rather than as a
local rule: never re-base a read onto its register carrier, so an object is the
value and every wider read is the explicit composition the alias repair already
builds. With today's merge composition in place this no longer costs `pearson`,
which is what it cost before that fix existed.

The result is worth stating precisely. **Forty-nine cells pass and four fail,
and none of the four is wrong** -- every failure is a compile error, and the
differential oracle reports no incorrect answer anywhere. So the semantics of
per-lane objects hold; what does not hold is a typing agreement, and not the one
expected. The four failures are all the same shape:

    error: conflicting types for 'sym__rotl32'
      uint64_t sym__rotl32(uint64_t, uint64_t);        // at the call site
      uint64_t sym__rotl32(uint32_t EDI_0, uint8_t ... // the definition

Without re-basing, a callee's parameters take the width the callee actually
reads -- `uint32_t` and `uint8_t`, which is `rotl32`'s true signature -- while
the declaration the caller emits for it still states the register widths. The
two views of one function disagree, and that disagreement was previously hidden
because both were widened to the carrier.

**Option B, narrowed and measured again.** A callee's parameters have their width
fixed by the ABI and not by what its body reads, so the rule is: a value the
function *computed* is read at its own width, a value it was *entered with* keeps
machine width. That removes the prototype conflicts entirely -- fifty-three of
fifty-four with all four scores equal, no cell lost -- and with `NEON_ushl`
applied on top, **all fifty-four cells generate and compile under the strict
flags**. The object-width question is answered.

One cell then computes the wrong digest, and tracing it named a defect that is
older than any of this. A lane's bit offset is applied **twice** whenever the
value read was composed inside the function: once by the operand's own
projection, and once by the extracting operation, which already carries that
offset. Thirty-one sites in one function, each evaluating to a hard zero, and
they are unchanged whichever way the read side is decided -- reads of values the
function *loaded* apply the offset once and are correct, which is the
discriminator. Removing the duplicate at those thirty-one sites and nothing else
restores every expected digest, verified against all twenty-two harness cases.

So the operand slice handed to an extracting operation should be the whole value,
with the extraction left to the operation that is already doing it. That is a
third layer again -- `machine_use_slice_for_input` -- and re-basing was masking
it rather than causing it.

So option B is the right direction and has one named blocker: a call site must
declare a callee with the types that callee's own rendering recovered. That is a
coherence requirement between two renderings of the same function, which is a
different piece of work from the object-width question and a well-formed one.

So the object-width model needs one coherent decision rather than another local
rule. Two are available: an object is as wide as the widest thing done with it
and every narrow write into it is an insert with a defined starting value; or
objects are per lane and every wider read is an explicit composition. The corpus
has been measured against four local answers and each moves the failure rather
than removing it.

**Settled, and not by any of the six local rules.** See the closing entry at the
end of this track: the width question was the wrong frame, and what actually
remained was an offset described twice.

## Track E -- the two capabilities Track D's last three cells need

Track D's gate was written as fifty-four of fifty-four with the four scores
equal. Fifty-two of those cells are there. The other three are not blocked by
anything Track D describes: each needs a capability the model does not have, and
a gate that requires unplanned capabilities is a defect in the plan rather than
a debt in the code. They are specified here so the work is scoped, and Track D's
gate should be read as every cell the stated scope covers until this track
lands.

### E1 -- Sleigh userop identity and semantics

`SSAOp::CallOther` carries `userop: u32` and nothing else. The index comes from
the Sleigh specification's userop table, and that table is not read anywhere:
the lift discards it, so no consumer can say which operation an index names.
Matching on the bare integer would be exactly the unsourced inference Track B
exists to make unrepresentable, so the name has to travel first.

- **E1.1** Read the userop table from the loaded specification and carry the
  names through `build_arch_spec` into `ArchSpec`, the way register names are
  carried. Gate: the name for a known index is retrievable from the artifact,
  and an index the specification does not define resolves to nothing.

  **Blocked, and the blocker is outside this repository.** `libsla` 1.2.0 --
  pinned exactly -- exposes no userop table: its public surface has no accessor
  over Ghidra's `UserOpManage`, and its `PseudoOp::CallOther` carries only the
  opcode. The compiled `.sla` cannot be read around it either: it is packed
  (`sla.x`), and `NEON_ext` and `NEON_ushl` appear nowhere in its bytes. The
  `.slaspec` sources do ship with `sleigh-config` and declare both with
  `define pcodeop`, but recovering an index from declaration order would be
  reconstructing the compiler's own numbering by inference -- the exact thing
  Track B removed -- and it would break silently the first time the
  specification changed. So E1 waits on an upstream change that exposes the
  userop names.

  **Raised, and verified end to end:** mnemonikr/libsla-sys#8 adds
  `SleighProxy::getUserOpNamesProxy`, exposed as `user_op_names`, reaching the
  list `SleighBase` already keeps and `Translate::getUserOpNames` already
  declares. mnemonikr/libsla#18 is the safe passthrough on top of it --
  `Sleigh::user_op_names` and `user_op_name(index)` -- raised as a draft because
  it depends on the first. Both were built together locally and the property
  E1.2 needs was tested rather than assumed: a name the x86 specification
  declares resolves back to itself through its own index, and an index past the
  end resolves to nothing. So the premise of this track is confirmed, not
  hoped for. Until
  both land, E1.2 through E1.4 have nothing to key on and the two arm64 -O2
  cells stay refused.
- **E1.2** Carry the resolved name on the lifted operation, so `CallOther`
  states which userop it is rather than which slot it occupies. Gate: the
  wire and the SSA operation both round-trip the name.
- **E1.3** Give the machine projection arms keyed by name, beginning with the
  two the corpus needs: `ext`, a lane-wise byte extract across a pair of
  128-bit values, and `ushl`, a lane-wise variable shift. An unnamed or
  unimplemented userop must keep refusing, and the refusal must name the
  instruction rather than the lowest-numbered constant that failed with it --
  the current message reports an authority that did not fail.
- **E1.4** Render the results. The type layer tops out at `__uint128_t` with no
  lane structure, so a lane-wise operation has to be spelled as masked shifts
  over that scalar. Gate: `crc32_bitwise` and `xxhash32` at arm64 -O2 render and
  pass the differential oracle.

### E2 -- Constant data emission

`crc32_bitwise` at x64 -O2 loads a sixteen-byte constant table with `movdqa`.
The address is a literal with no rendered occurrence, and no corpus function has
ever rendered a load from a fixed data address. Rendering one means the emitted C
carries the table's bytes; without that the differential oracle compares against
a table the rendered program does not have.

- **E2.1** Account a certified access address that renders through an object
  name, so the literal is elided with a stated reason instead of left
  unaccounted. Gate: the obligation ledger balances for a function with such a
  load.
- **E2.2** ~~Emit the referenced constant bytes as a declared object.~~ Not
  needed: the verifier already does this. `map_image_data` finds certified image
  literals in the rendered C, cuts the bytes out of the binary, and emits them as
  `corpus_blob_N`, rewriting the absolute address into that blob -- `pearson`'s
  table is the case it was written for. The decompiler only has to spell the
  address.
- **E2.3** The object width. This is the whole of what is left, and it is not
  the lane projection. Three things were implemented and measured:

  E2.1 works. The address of a certified access is built by the memory renderer
  itself rather than through the operand-observation path, so the read is never
  marked; that does not matter while the address is a computation whose parts
  are observed on their way in, and it does matter when the address is a bare
  literal. Marking it, together with admitting lanes at a non-zero offset,
  **renders the cell** -- fifty-two of fifty-four, with no cell lost.

  It does not compile. Every binding comes out `struct r2sleigh_bits_512`,
  including 32-bit lanes, because the binding width takes the *carrier* width
  from each use projection and the x86 specification nests the vector registers
  inside `ZMM`. Bounding the width by how far a read actually reaches instead of
  by the carrier was tried and **cost four cells**: the carrier width is
  load-bearing on the use side, since a projection extracts from a
  carrier-wide value. Both changes are therefore reverted, since neither alone
  changes any rendered output.

  A fourth attempt: suppressing the re-basing of a read onto the register
  carrier when the value's own definition was a lane write -- on the ground that
  a lane write preserves nothing, so there is no carrier content for a read to
  be composed out of. That is coherent, and it **costs `pearson` at x64 -O2**, a
  cell that passes today and then refuses for a missing machine projection. So
  the re-basing is load-bearing for a lane-written value that is genuinely read
  as part of its carrier, and any rule that skips it has to tell that case
  apart -- the candidate being a value every one of whose uses reads exactly the
  lane it wrote, true of the vector lanes and false of `pearson`. Four approaches at this layer have now been
  measured and rejected; the next attempt should not be a fifth projection
  tweak.

  A fifth attempt narrowed the fourth: skip the re-basing only for a lane value
  *every* one of whose reads takes the whole value, which is true of the vector
  lanes and was expected to be false of `pearson`. It is not false of `pearson`,
  which refuses as well. So the re-basing is load-bearing for a reason the
  operation-relative slices do not express, and no predicate written at this
  layer has separated the two cases in five tries. The next attempt should come
  from the renderer, not the projection.

  A sixth attempt got the furthest and is the most important result here. Three
  changes together -- admitting lanes at any offset, not re-basing a lane value
  no read reaches outside of (stated once and consulted by both the derivation
  and its validator, so they cannot drift), and marking the address operand of a
  certified access as the read it is -- **render the cell**. Fifty-two of
  fifty-four generate, every audit passes on all fifty-two, `pearson` keeps
  working, and the 512-bit declarations are gone.

  It computes the wrong answer. The differential oracle catches it: `crc32` of a
  one-byte input comes back `8bb1d29a` where the oracle says `ad68e236`. So the
  carrier re-basing is not bookkeeping that can be skipped for a value whose
  reads all name its own width -- something in the composition genuinely depends
  on it, and dropping it silently changes what the program computes. This is the
  same failure mode as the linearized switch arms: it compiles, it looks right,
  and it is wrong, which is worse than the refusal it replaced.

  A seventh attempt found what the sixth had actually done, and it was not what
  the sixth's conclusion said. Reading the wrong output against the machine code
  shows one expression shape repeated fifteen times: a lane read applies its bit
  offset **twice** -- `(uint32_t)((__uint128_t)(uint32_t)(X >> N) >> N)` -- once
  in the operand's projection and once in the extracting operation, which
  already applies it. Every lane above the first therefore reads as identically
  zero, `pcmpeqd` compares zero against zero and answers all-ones, and the
  horizontal XOR reduction collapses to lane zero. Verified numerically: a model
  following the instructions reproduces the reference CRC for all 256 single
  bytes, and a model following the rendered C reproduces the wrong `8bb1d29a`.
  So the composition does *not* depend on the re-basing; the sixth attempt
  simply double-counted, and its conclusion was wrong.

  Reading a self-contained value as itself -- no projection at all, since the
  object *is* the value -- fixes that, and the corpus then reads **52 of 54 with
  all four scores equal and the differential oracle green**, `pearson` included.

  It is still not landable, and the reason is worth more than the score. A test
  written to guard the other half of the rule fails: a byte written at offset
  eight and then read back through the whole eight-byte register comes out as a
  lane, so the rendering would assign the whole object from one byte and lose the
  other seven. The write rule decides lane-versus-insert from the writing
  instruction's own operands and cannot see the later read. The corpus does not
  contain that shape, which is exactly why the corpus cannot be the authority
  here.

  **Done.** The projection build now settles every operand read before it
  settles any write, so both rules consult one predicate instead of the write
  rule guessing from the writing instruction's own operands. Two things had to be
  narrowed before it was sound:

  A write at a non-zero offset is a lane only when nothing reads the value
  outside itself; at offset zero the rule is unchanged, so a value nothing reads
  keeps the conservative answer it had. And a read is taken as the value itself
  only when a lane write actually *defined* that value -- a sub-register the
  function merely reads is a window onto machine state the whole register still
  owns, and its reads stay carrier-relative. That distinction is what separates
  the vector lanes from `mov ah, bl`, and from an entry sub-register read.

  Every invariant test in the tree passes unchanged, including the guard above,
  which fails against the unsound version. The corpus reads **52 of 54 with all
  four scores equal and the differential oracle green**. The rendering that follows
  from that is a single composed assignment of the whole object, not four writes
  into a carrier-wide object that must then be read to preserve what they did
  not touch. Gate: `crc32_bitwise` at x64 -O2 renders, compiles under the strict
  flags, and passes the differential oracle.


## Track D closed: fifty-four of fifty-four

The gate is met. Generation, strict compilation, diagnostic compilation and the
differential oracle all read fifty-four, with 2222 tests and no clippy warning.

Three changes closed it, and the first is the one the six earlier attempts kept
circling without seeing.

**An extracting operation's operand is read whole.** Where the extraction sits is
the operation's own semantics and the operation renders it. Describing it again
as a property of the read applied the offset twice, and a lane that shifts twice
is zero. It stayed hidden because a register operand read as itself already has
its slice replaced with a whole read, so only values composed inside the function
-- which carry no canonical storage and keep the recorded slice -- ever showed
it. The record and the mirror it is validated against have to move together:
changing the mirror alone makes every extraction fail validation, and that, not
any semantic dependence, is why the earlier attempt fell to three cells.

**A computed value is read at the width it holds; an entered value keeps machine
width.** The second is an ABI fact rather than a use fact -- narrowing an
incoming argument to whatever the body reads makes a function disagree with the
declaration its caller writes, and the two renderings then do not compile
together. For a computed value there is no such contract, and re-basing it onto
its register only forced objects as wide as whatever the specification nests that
register in, which for the vector registers is a carrier no program here
addresses.

**`NEON_ushl` expanded element by element**, each element shifted by the signed
low byte of the corresponding element of the second operand, in the direction of
its sign, and to zero once the distance reaches the element's width.

What the six failed attempts were worth: every one of them adjusted *which*
values are read as themselves, and the defect was that an offset was stated
twice. The measurements are kept above because they are what ruled that framing
out, and because two of them produced output that was wrong rather than refused
-- caught by the differential oracle and not by any audit the renderer performs
on itself.
