radare2 Plugin
==============

Architecture
------------

The r2sleigh radare2 plugin consists of two layers:

1. Rust cdylib (libr2sleigh_plugin.so) -- exports C-ABI functions
2. C wrapper (r_anal_sleigh.c) -- implements RAnalPlugin/RArchPlugin

Architecture Detection
----------------------

Reads anal.arch and anal.bits from radare2:
- x86 + 64 bits -> x86-64
- x86 + 32 bits -> x86
- arm -> arm
- riscv + 64 bits -> riscv64
- riscv + 32 bits -> riscv32
- mips -> mips

Maintainer override: `a:sla.debug.arch x86-64`

Plugin Callbacks
----------------

sleigh_op: Lifts instructions during aaa. Generates ESIL.
sleigh_analyze_fcn: Per-function SSA analysis after af (also auto-applies DATA xrefs).
sleigh_get_data_refs: Def-use xrefs callback used by radare2 during aar when supported.
sleigh_post_analysis: Native post-analysis enrichment during aa/aaa/aaaa.

Command Reference
-----------------

Instruction-Level:
- a:sla -- Status and help
- a:sla.debug.info -- Architecture info
- a:sla.debug.arch [name] -- Get/set architecture

Function-Level:
- a:sla.debug.ssa.func -- Function SSA with phi nodes

- pd:s -- Decompile through r2sleigh's bounded borrowed snapshot

`pd:s` is the only decompile route. It receives one
ABI-139/snapshot-schema-12 borrowed snapshot through accessor-schema 5,
deep-copies it synchronously into source-interface-schema 10, and either
completes from that immutable source or refuses. It never falls back to live
blocks, names, or detached test metadata. The direct `a:sla.dec` and
`a:sla.decj` commands, which could not construct source authority and only ever
refused, are deleted rather than kept as shims.

The `a:sym.*` namespace is gone with the symbolic-execution subsystem it named.
The plugin no longer answers for that prefix at all.

Executable semantic C is authorized only through the generic source-obligation
ledger and typed output-node ownership. Every live machine effect from the
immutable source revision must have exactly one certified typed owner; missing,
duplicate, unsupported, or foreign ownership residualizes or refuses without
falling through to legacy C.

Benchmark-shaped branchless guards and struct-array updates are regression
inputs, not production recognizers or renderer routes. They currently remain
residual until generic typed expression, return, aggregate-memory, and lvalue
regions can close their complete ledgers. Consequently,
`semantic_kernel_render` is present only when a generic certified region owns
the exact source revision; its absence for those fixtures is expected.

Function signatures, layouts, and calling-convention carriers come only from
the immutable radare2 function snapshot. DWARF ingestion is a binary-load
operation in radare2; the plugin never reparses or imports DWARF during
analysis or decompilation.

Snapshot-owned type inference and writeback are not yet exposed through a
radare2 host callback, so no detached r2sleigh type-report command is exposed.
Type/writeback integration must use an equivalent locked snapshot transaction;
radare2's `afcfj` and `afvj` remain the genuine host-owned inspection path.

DATA xrefs are applied automatically during function analysis (`af`) and reference
analysis (`aar`) via plugin callbacks.

Instruction Export Path
-----------------------

Instruction-level plugin renderers now use the shared `r2sleigh-export`
pipeline internally:

- `r2il_block_op_json_named`
- `r2il_block_to_esil`
- `r2il_block_to_ssa_json`
- `r2il_block_defuse_json`
- `r2dec_block`

This keeps CLI and plugin output logic aligned. The supported external C ABI is
the versioned V2 function table; retired direct legacy exports are not preserved.

The shared action/format policy is:

- `lift`: `json`, `text`, `esil`, `r2cmd`
- `ssa`: `json`, `text`
- `defuse`: `json`, `text`
- `dec`: `c_like`, `json`, `text`

Endianness
----------

Canonical endianness fields live in `ArchSpec` (`instruction_endianness`,
`memory_endianness`). The retired direct `r2il_is_big_endian` export is not part
of the V2 ABI.

Configuration
-------------

`a:sla.debug.mem` emits one canonical JSON array. Every access object has:

- `schema_version` (`1`)
- `type` (`load`, `store`, `load_linked`, `store_conditional`, `atomic_cas`,
  `load_guarded`, or `store_guarded`)
- `size_bytes`
- `address` (a typed varnode object)

Stores and atomic/guarded operations add their applicable typed varnodes as
`value`, `expected`, `replacement`, `result`, or `guard`. A structurally
resolved stack address is represented only as
`stack_address: {"base": "RSP", "offset": 0}`.

When available, access objects also emit memory semantics/topology fields:

- `ordering`
- `atomic_kind`
- `guarded`
- `permissions`
- `range`
- `bank_id`
- `segment_id`
- `memory_class`

SLEIGH_TAINT_MAX_BLOCKS: Max blocks for auto-taint. Default 200.
SLEIGH_SIG_WRITEBACK_MAX_BLOCKS: Max blocks for automatic signature/CC write-back. Default 200.
SLEIGH_SIG_MIN_CONFIDENCE: Minimum confidence for signature overwrite. Default 70.
SLEIGH_CC_MIN_CONFIDENCE: Minimum confidence for calling convention overwrite. Default 80.

Native analysis depth:

| Command | r2sleigh behavior |
|---|---|
| `aa` | basic bounded post-analysis |
| `aaa` | balanced signatures, xrefs, and type facts |
| `aaaa` | aggressive taint, interproc, and type write-back |

r2sleigh does not expose public `anal.*` tuning keys. `a:sla.debug.profilej` is
a passive local timing accumulator: run a successful command such as
`a:sla.debug.ssa.func` first, then read the profile. There is no detached
type-report command; host type state is inspected with radare2's `afcfj` and
`afvj` commands until a locked snapshot-owned type callback exists.

Kernel smoke harness:

```bash
R2SLEIGH_KERNELCACHE=/path/to/kernelcache \
  scripts/kernel_smoke.py \
  --r2 /Users/priyanshu/code/radare2/binr/radare2/radare2 \
  --analysis aaaa \
  --strict \
  --out /tmp/r2sleigh-kernel-smoke.json
```

The harness is advisory and local-only: no kernel binaries or generated smoke
reports are committed. It probes representative kernel helpers and records
normalized decompile and exact-target SSA-function JSON for regression triage. Host type state
is inspected separately through radare2's `afcfj` and `afvj` commands.
By default the report keeps hashes, sizes, and line counts while redacting the
local kernel path and stdout/stderr previews. Use `--include-sensitive` only for
local triage when full paths and text previews are needed.

Strict mode returns non-zero for missing requested targets, zero discovered
functions, malformed or wrong-target SSA-function JSON, decompiler fallback comments, and
radare2 command return failures. The harness mirrors the r2r/e2e plugin
isolation knobs where practical: `--plugin-dir` defaults to
`R2SLEIGH_PLUGIN_DIR`, `R2R_PLUGIN_DIR`, or `R2_LIBR_PLUGINS`, and `--tmpdir`
sets a temporary HOME/XDG/TMP root for radare2 subprocesses.

Automatic Signature Write-Back (aaaa)
-------------------------------------

During `aaaa`, the plugin also performs function signature + calling convention
write-back:

- Builds SSA and infers return/parameter types.
- Applies inferred signatures on any supported loaded architecture via direct `RAnal` update first (`r_anal_str_to_fcn`), then falls back to `afs` if needed.
- Applies inferred calling conventions only when the payload contains a non-empty verified calling convention. In practice this is currently strongest on x86/x86-64.
- Confidence-gated overwrite: signature `>= 70`, calling convention `>= 80`.
- Practical consistency verification is currently disabled by default.
- After verified signature apply, direct caller xrefs are propagated in a
  targeted pass:
  - xref scope: direct `CALL/CODE/JUMP` refs only.
  - caller reanalysis: type-match + `afva` var recovery.
  - each caller function is updated at most once per `aaaa` run.
- Propagation metrics are logged in summary (`prop_*`) with
  `sample_callees=` trace for up to 5 triggered callees.
- Write-back metrics include apply path counters (`sig_api_apply_ok`,
  `sig_api_verify_fail`, `sig_cmd_fallback_attempted`, `sig_cmd_apply_ok`,
  `sig_cmd_apply_fail`, `cc_api_apply_ok`, `cc_api_verify_fail`,
  `cc_cmd_fallback_attempted`, `cc_cmd_apply_ok`, `cc_cmd_apply_fail`).
- Preserves existing function names (no rename during write-back).
- Skips functions above `SLEIGH_SIG_WRITEBACK_MAX_BLOCKS`.
