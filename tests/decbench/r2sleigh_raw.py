"""Raw r2sleigh backend (native, via the ``r2`` CLI).

r2sleigh (https://github.com/0verflowme/r2sleigh) is a radare2 plugin whose
decompiler is a Rust pipeline: Ghidra Sleigh lift -> its own IL -> SSA -> machine
projection -> a sealed binding plan -> C rendering. It is a *refusal-first*
decompiler: where it cannot prove what a construct means it emits a typed
refusal instead of plausible C, so a function is either rendered or reported as
declined, never guessed.

Like ``glaurung`` and ``kuna`` it is driven as a CLI rather than imported, but
unlike them the CLI is radare2 itself. One ``r2`` process per binary does the
whole job::

    r2 -e scr.color=0 -q -c 'a:sla; aaa; <per-function seek and pdd>' <binary>

``a:sla`` swaps radare2's architecture plugin for the Sleigh-backed one, which
is what makes ``pdd`` render r2sleigh's output rather than the stock r2dec one,
so it must run before analysis. Functions are marked in the stream with
``R2SLEIGH_DECBENCH_BEGIN__<index>`` / ``..._END__<index>`` sentinels and split
back out here; one process amortises the ``aaa`` that dominates the wall time.

Discovery comes from radare2's own analysis (``aflj``), so this works on
stripped binaries, and addresses are normalised the way the dockerized r2dec
driver does it -- ``addr - baddr + elf_min_vaddr`` -- because radare2 loads at
its own ``baddr``.

A declined function is *omitted* rather than emitted as its refusal comment.
Scoring a refusal marker as if it were decompiled C would report a parse failure
where the tool actually reported an honest decline, and both are zero on every
metric anyway; the counts are kept in the result metadata so the decline rate
stays visible.

Two very different things can leave a function with no output, and this adapter
keeps them apart. r2sleigh declining is an answer. The ``r2`` process dying
part-way through the batch is the harness failing to ask, and because the batch
is one process, every function past the cut would otherwise look exactly like a
decline -- which is how five zlib binaries reported zero functions apiece
without anyone reading it as a crash. Those functions are declined with a
``harness:`` cause naming how the process ended and where the stream stopped,
and the run's metadata records the ending of both ``r2`` passes.

Locate the CLI via ``$R2SLEIGH_R2_BIN`` (an explicit ``r2`` path) or ``r2`` on
``$PATH``. The plugin itself must already be installed into radare2's plugin
directory (``make -C r2plugin install`` in the r2sleigh tree); availability is
probed by checking that ``a:sla`` actually switches the architecture.
