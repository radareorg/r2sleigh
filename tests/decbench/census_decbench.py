"""Rank refusal causes across a sweep's per-binary censuses.

The benchmark's own results carry one boolean per function, so a sweep answers
*how many* functions were declined and never *why*.  Each binary writes a
census beside the run (``r2sleigh-refusals-*.json``); this reads a directory of
them and reports the ranking that coverage work is supposed to be planned
against.

Two distinctions the report keeps, because collapsing either one has already
misdirected a session's work:

*Harness failures are not refusals.*  A cause prefixed ``harness:`` is this
tooling saying it never got to ask -- a crashed ``r2``, a plugin that would not
load.  Counting those as the decompiler declining is how five zlib binaries
reporting zero functions read as an unusually shy decompiler while holding 68%
of the benchmark's refusals.  They are ranked separately and, being tooling
defects rather than proof gaps, ranked first.

*Causes compose multiplicatively.*  A census records only the first cause per
function, so ``P(render) = prod(1 - p_i)`` and closing the top cause unmasks
the next.  A share here is an upper bound on what closing that cause buys, and
the ranking must be retaken after each one is closed rather than planned once.
