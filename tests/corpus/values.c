/* Value-hazard corpus for r2sleigh rendering evaluation.

   shapes.c asked whether the decompiler can render a program shape at all, and
   the answer was mostly no: eleven of its thirteen functions refuse, naming the
   rule that declined. A refusal is the honest outcome and it is not the
   dangerous one. The one shape that rendered and was wrong -- a variadic call
   losing its arguments on arm64 while refusing correctly on x64 -- taught more
   than the other twelve together, because a confident wrong answer is the
   failure this project treats as worse than declining.

   So these functions are built to fail open. Every one is a leaf: no calls, no
   address-taken locals, no arrays, no aggregates. There is no call boundary to
   refuse at and no frame object to decline, so the renderer has nothing to
   stop on and must commit to an answer. What is left is arithmetic, and each
   function isolates one place where the machine's arithmetic and C's differ in
   a way a reader cannot see: sign versus zero extension, arithmetic versus
   logical shift, signed versus unsigned comparison, the bias a compiler adds
   before dividing a negative number by a power of two, the high half of a
   multiply, carry, overflow, byte order.

   Getting any of them wrong produces a plausible number rather than a refusal.
   That is the point.

   Every function is a pure function of its two arguments, is defined for every
   possible pair -- shift counts are masked, counts of leading zeros guard the
   zero case, and negation is done in unsigned arithmetic so INT64_MIN has an
   answer -- and uses both arguments. */
