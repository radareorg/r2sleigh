/* Shape corpus for r2sleigh rendering evaluation.

   The hash corpus proves one program shape: a loop over bytes accumulating an
   integer.  Nine functions, nine variations on that shape, and nothing else.
   Three defects found by an external benchmark were invisible to it because
   none of them can occur in that shape -- a variadic call losing arguments, a
   stack pointer that never recovers the eight bytes an x86-64 `call` pushes,
   and a call rendered with no arguments at all.

   Every function scored here is `uint64_t shape_*(uint64_t, uint64_t)`, so the
   harness hands it two integers and compares one integer back.  The shape under
   test lives inside the body and in the noinline helpers it calls, which the
   verifier pulls in from their own renderings.  Each result is a pure function
   of the two arguments: no output, no clock, and no address ever reaches the
   returned value, because an address would differ between the oracle and the
   rendering for reasons that are not defects.

   Every helper is noinline so it survives -O2 as its own symbol and the call is
   still a call at every optimization level. */
