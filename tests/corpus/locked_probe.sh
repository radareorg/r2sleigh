# Every worktree installs to ~/.local/share/radare2/plugins, so a bare `r2 -c
# pd:s` measures whichever tree installed last. That has now cost this project
# five conclusions -- four before this file existed and one after -- and every
# one of them looked like a real finding until it was repeated. Writing the
# hazard down did not stop it, because the failure is silent: nothing about a
# stale plugin's output says it is stale.
#
# So this builds first without the lock, then holds
# /tmp/r2sleigh-plugin-install.lock across the install and the command
# together, which is the only window in which the answer is about this tree.
