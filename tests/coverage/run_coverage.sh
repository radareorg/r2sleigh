# Whole-binary render coverage: every function radare2 finds, not a named few.
#
# The 54-cell matrix scores nine hand-picked functions and checks that what they
# render is correct. That is a canary and does not answer the other question --
# how much of a binary renders at all -- which was measured by hand, and was
# wrong twice: once by a factor of six, because import thunks were counted as
# functions, and once by fourteen refusals, because the number was carried
# forward from an older tree instead of remeasured.
#
# This decompiles every function in the corpus binaries and records, per
# function, whether it rendered and the typed cause when it did not. The
# baseline is blessed like the raw one. A function that rendered and now
# refuses fails the gate; a function that now renders is reported and needs
# --accept-baseline to be recorded.

# project is scored against uses GCC, so a defect that appears only in GCC's

# 11 somewhere in this branch while this harness reported 243 of 313 unchanged
# throughout, because it never looked. That is the corpus-as-specification
# mistake moved from correctness to coverage.
#
# The dump name carries a short hash of the binary, so another machine's
# `/bin/ls` is a different cell rather than a silent comparison against a
# program it does not have: the report says `appeared` and `vanished` instead
# of inventing a regression. A binary that is not present is skipped and said
# so, because a gate that quietly measures less is the thing being fixed here.
# These cells are measured and reported and never gate, because the machine
# running the gate decides which program they name. The pinned cells above are
# the gating half of the same idea.
