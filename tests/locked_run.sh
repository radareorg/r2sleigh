# Build this tree's plugin unlocked, then run a command while holding the

#
# Every worktree installs to ~/.local/share/radare2/plugins, so anything that
# installs and then measures is measuring whichever tree installed last unless
# the two happen together. That has cost this project five conclusions, and
# every one of them looked like a real finding until it was repeated. Nothing
# about a stale plugin's output says it is stale.
#
# The build is deliberately outside the lock. A cold release build takes
# minutes, and holding the lock through it means nobody measures and nobody
# else can start for the whole time. Building first cuts the held window to the
# install and the measurement, which is the only part that has to be exclusive.
#
# This is the one place that logic lives. tests/corpus/locked_matrix.sh,
# tests/corpus/locked_probe.sh and tests/coverage/locked_coverage.sh each pass
# their own command to it and add nothing else.

# rather than kill the run: an abort with no message is the failure mode this

the tree changed while this run waited for the lock

The build happened before the lock and the command inside it builds again, so
continuing would install and measure the edited tree while reporting it as the
one that was built. That is the stale-plugin hazard turned inside out, and it is
silent: nothing about the output would say which tree it describes.

Nothing was installed. Re-run when the tree is settled, and do not edit while a
locked run is queued.
