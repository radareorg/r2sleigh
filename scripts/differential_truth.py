"""Score recovery and soundness against a debug build of the same binary.

The same source compiled twice gives exact ground truth for free: the build
that kept its debug info says what every function really is, and the stripped
build is what the plugin has to work from. Every fact the plugin recovers from
the stripped build lands in one of four buckets.

    correct          recovered and it matches the debug build
    missing          the debug build has it and the plugin does not
    marked-wrong     recovered wrongly, but the function carries a residual
                     marker, so a reader was told not to trust it
    silently-wrong   recovered wrongly and asserted as if proven

Recovery is how much of the truth comes back. Soundness is the share of
asserted facts that are not silently wrong, and it is the number that matters:
a decompiler that guesses confidently is worse than one that says it does not
know. Silently-wrong is a defect at the highest severity, never a quality nit.

The marker granularity is the function, because that is the granularity the
renderer annotates at. A function carrying any residual has its unmatched facts
counted as marked rather than silent.
