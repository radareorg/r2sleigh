//! Certified canonicalising rewriter over `r2ssa` machine expressions.
//!
//! The base machine arena is one node deep per instruction and is validated
//! structurally against the SSA graph, so it is never rewritten in place.
//! This crate imports it into a hash-consed term arena, canonicalises every
//! value's term with a table of rules that are each a proven equivalence, and
//! reports per value the canonical term, the rules that produced it, and the
//! instructions rendering it would discharge. The binding plan decides what
//! to render; this crate decides what is equal to what.
