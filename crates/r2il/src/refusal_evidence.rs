//! What the predicate that refused was looking at.
//!
//! A refusal already records where it was decided, and where is never the
//! question. Every investigation into one starts the same way: print the
//! operands the failing predicate compared, then read the code around them.
//! Four separate defects were found that way in one session, each by adding a
//! temporary `eprintln` and removing it again, which is four chances to
//! instrument the wrong branch and four probes that taught the next reader
//! nothing.
//!
//! So the operands stay. `refusal_evidence!` prints them under
//! `R2DEC_TRACE_REFUSAL`, beside the refusal's own line, and costs nothing when
//! the variable is unset: the arguments live inside the macro body and are
//! never evaluated.
//!
//! It lives in the base crate because refusing is not one layer's job. The
//! lift, the SSA and the renderer all decline, and the answer to "why" is as
//! often in a predicate below the renderer as in one inside it -- the return
//! kind a function's recovered interface claims is decided in `r2ssa`, and the
//! renderer can only report that the boundary it produced was incomplete.
//!
//! This is deliberately a diagnostic channel and not a payload the refusal
//! carries. What travels with a refusal is its static site name, which is free
//! and reaches the reader through the rendered comment; what the predicate saw
//! is unbounded, per-function, and only wanted when someone is looking.
