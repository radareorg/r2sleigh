//! Names in the output that the function does not declare.
//!
//! A rendering that is incomplete is a smaller failure than one that is wrong,
//! and a rendering that is wrong is far worse when nothing distinguishes it
//! from one that is right. The renderer sometimes emits an identifier that
//! names nothing: a Sleigh temporary such as `tmpOV`, a raw register such as
//! `x8`, or a frame slot such as `local_10` reaching the page as though it
//! were a variable of the program. `(a > 0)` has been printed as
//! `(!(a == 0) && a < 0 == tmpOV)`, and a parameter has been assigned the
//! address of its own home slot, `x = local_10 + 8`.
//!
//! Those are not program text. They were printed with exactly the confidence
//! of the lines around them and carried no marker, so the proof note called
//! the function unremarkable while part of it said nothing true.
//!
//! The test is the one the language already makes: an identifier a function
//! neither takes as a parameter nor declares as a local refers to nothing.
//! Names carrying a namespace -- `sym.imp.malloc`, `dbg.process_string` -- are
//! radare2's spelling for something outside the function and are left alone.
//!
//! The marker names what it found in the terms the comment sanitizer allows --
//! a stack slot, a register, a temporary -- rather than the raw token. The
//! token itself is printed by the statement on the next line, so nothing is
//! withheld by saying it that way.
