/// Proof that a refusal was decided through a constructor, and where.

/// The field is private to this module, so no other module can name it and no

/// left holes, twice, and a refusal that escaped the instrumentation cost a
/// full pass to find each time. Now the compiler enumerates them.
///
/// The witness also carries where it was made, and takes it from
/// `#[track_caller]` rather than from an argument. Naming seventy-two
/// construction sites by hand would have been the same mistake in a new place:
/// one unnamed site is one refusal that reports nothing. A caller location is
/// a `&'static` reference, so carrying it is free, and it separates causes that
/// were previously one word -- on `/bin/ls` a single count of seven "op
/// lowering" refusals turned out to be an incomplete return boundary and a call
/// whose arguments could not be spelled, at two different lines.
///
/// What the predicate compared is a different thing and does not travel here:
/// it is unbounded and only wanted when someone is looking, which is what
/// `refusal_evidence!` prints.
