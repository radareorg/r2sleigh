/// One parsed Sleigh specification: everything derived from the `.sla` and the
/// processor spec, and nothing derived from who asked for it.
///
/// Parsing one is the single most expensive thing this crate does -- 58 to 91
/// milliseconds for x86-64, against 21 to 83 *micro*seconds to lift a block --
/// and it was being done three times over. `Disassembler::from_trusted_profile`
/// did it on the lift path, and `create_disassembler_for_arch` in the plugin
/// did it twice more for one `R2ILContext`: once through `build_arch_spec` for
/// the architecture and once through `from_sla` for the disassembler. Splitting
/// the parse from the caller's identity is what lets all three share one, and
/// putting the split here rather than a cache at each call site is what stops
/// there being a fourth.
///
/// The lift authority is minted with the specification rather than per
/// disassembler because minting copies the whole `.sla` into an `Arc` and
/// hashes it. Its documented meaning is unchanged: equality is the identity of
/// a load event, and there is now one load event per specification instead of
