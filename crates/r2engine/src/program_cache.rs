//! Prepared SSA, kept for the life of the process and keyed by what built it.
//!
//! Every request arrives as one wire snapshot carrying the function asked for
//! and the bodies of the functions it calls, and the ingress lifted and
//! prepared every one of them on every request. Measured on the DecBench
//! `bzip2recover` build, three identical `pd:s` calls on one function in one
//! radare2 session cost `callee_lift` 1.46s, 1.52s and 0.95s for the same
//! three callees, against a `decode` of 50 microseconds. Roughly eighty per
//! cent of a capture was work whose inputs had not changed since the last time
//! it was done.
//!
//! **The key is the input, byte for byte, not a hash of it.** A miss here
//! costs time; a wrong hit renders a body that is not the function's, and
//! nothing downstream would say so. A hash small enough to store is two claims
//! at once -- that it covers every input, and that no two inputs collide --
//! and neither can be checked here. The serialized snapshot *is* the whole
//! input to a lift, by construction of the V2 boundary: there is no second way
//! to reach a source. So holding it and comparing it states the identity
//! exactly instead of asserting it, for a few kilobytes per function and one
//! `memcmp` per lookup against the hundreds of milliseconds it saves.
//!
//! The semantic fingerprint from `r2ssa::stable_ssa_semantic_fingerprint` is
//! recorded beside each entry rather than used as the key, which is the only
//! place it can honestly sit: it is computed *from* the prepared artifact, so
//! it cannot be known until the work it would avoid has been done. What it is
//! good for is saying which semantics an entry holds, which is what a reused
//! artifact is checked against.
//!
//! **What bounds it.** One entry per function address per preparation, replaced
//! rather than added to when that address's input changes. The entry count is
//! therefore the number of distinct function addresses the session has asked
//! about, at most twice over,
//! which is the program's own function count -- a bound the data sets rather
//! than a number picked to be large enough. Nothing is evicted while a session
//! runs, because an eviction policy would have to guess which function a later
//! request wants, and the analysis sweep this exists for asks about all of
//! them.
//!
//! **Why one function map rather than one per binary.** Reuse is gated on the input
//! bytes being identical, and a lift is a function of its input alone, so an
//! entry matching byte for byte returns the artifact that binary's own
//! snapshot would have produced, whichever binary recorded it. The address
//! selects a candidate; the bytes are what makes reusing it sound. A
//! per-binary handle would add a key that changes nothing about which answers
//! are correct.
//!
//! Data object types are different: their scope is the program, while a
//! snapshot and renderer are function-local. The cache therefore also holds a
//! monotone program view keyed by object address. A missing or unplaceable
//! observation cannot displace an accepted source fact, and two accepted types
//! for one address poison that address into an explicit conflict. That makes
//! accidental reuse across program sessions lose precision rather than render
//! the wrong type. The map is bounded by the distinct data addresses observed
//! in the session, which is the data that must clear it.
