/// by mode -- that were not derived from anything. Ten seconds is not a fact
/// about a program: on the DecBench bzip2recover build, 38 functions, the sweep
/// finishes in about 1.5 seconds and the budget never binds, while on bzip2,
/// 154 functions, the same ten seconds stopped the sweep after a third of the
/// program. One number cannot be both, because the work scales with the
/// function count and the number did not.
///
/// The allowance is the project's own per-function performance bar, which is
/// already agreed and stated elsewhere: a function is expected to cost under
/// 100 milliseconds net. So the budget is not a new judgement about how long is
/// too long; it is the bar the sweep is already held to, multiplied by the work
/// in front of it. A function that exceeds it is a defect to fix rather than a
/// budget to widen, and the sweep saying so is the point.
///
/// Measured against it, with the per-callback split on bzip2recover: the whole
/// sweep costs about 39ms per function -- an 11.5ms snapshot walk, a 17.6ms
/// proof, and artifact submission for the rest -- so the bar is cleared by
/// roughly a factor of two and a slower machine still finishes.

/// each function gets, not how long a wall clock may run, and expressing the
