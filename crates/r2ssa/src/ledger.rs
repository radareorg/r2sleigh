//! What became of every obligation the source inventory recorded.
//!
//! The inventory says what a function owes. Rendering discharges some of it,
//! proves some of it needs no output, and fails at the rest. Until now those
//! three answers were counted by walking the inventory at the end and asking
//! whether anything had been proven about each entry, which meant an obligation
//! nothing had an opinion about simply did not appear in any total: a body could
//! report "34 of 43 owned, 0 unsupported" with nine effects missing and no word
//! for them.
//!
//! A ledger cannot lose one. It opens holding every obligation the inventory
//! recorded, each undecided, and the only way an entry leaves that state is for
//! a layer to say what happened to it. Closing the ledger reports all four
//! counts and they sum to the total by construction, so the gap that used to be
//! silent is now a number with a name on it.
