//! Where a storage stops holding one value and starts holding another.
//!
//! A register is not a variable. A compiler will keep an accumulator in `RAX`
//! for one loop and an index in it for the next, and every layer that reasons
//! about "the value in `RAX`" then has to decide which of those it means. Loop
//! carriers make the problem sharp: a carrier is state a storage preserves
//! across a back edge, so a carrier can span a point where the storage changed
//! what it stands for, and naming all of its versions one variable says two
//! different values are one.
//!
//! What separates them is already in the dataflow. A definition that reads the
//! storage it writes is an update -- `x = x + 1` continues whatever `x` was --
//! while a definition that reads none of the storage's own values starts
//! something new, however the machine happens to spell the destination. Grouping
//! definitions by that rule cuts each storage into spans, and a span is the
//! thing a location has to be.
//!
//! The grouping is a disjoint set over values, so building it costs one pass over
//! the instructions and answering costs effectively constant time.
