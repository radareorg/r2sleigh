//! Which entries of a pointer table a call can actually reach.
//!
//! A call through `table[index]` reaches exactly the entries `index` can select,
//! and nothing else. The table's contents are a fact the source carries; the
//! range of the index is not, because it follows from the branches that had to
//! be taken to arrive at the call. Proving that range is what turns an opaque
//! dispatch into a set of real edges.
//!
//! The proof is deliberately narrow. A block that strictly dominates the call
//! and ends in a conditional branch tells us which way that branch went, but
//! only when exactly one of its successors dominates the call: if both do, the
//! condition says nothing about how we got here. Every such branch contributes
//! one bound on one value, the bounds are intersected, and a range that is not
//! fully pinned inside the table yields nothing at all.
//!
//! Failing closed is the point. An unproven target set would be a guess about
//! control flow, and a wrong edge is worse than a missing one.
